[{"bhkikm": ["Best Smart Home hub concerning security\nI'd  like to buy some smart home system to monitor my place when I'm out.  The functionality I need are motion sensors, flood sensors, door/window  open sensors and eventually cameras.\n\nI  wonder, however, about security of the system. I don't want a Amazon or  Google or 3rd party go gather (too much) data about me. My use case  excludes the need of constant listening (like Alexa) or even having a  mike. I just want to get a push notification on my phone when something  bad happens.\n\nI'm also concerned about  security of the gates and devices itself. How probable is that someone  will peek the data or take over the control of them? Which of the  systems are safest/best protected?\n\nIt would be great if the hub allow to connect devices from different manufacturers (based on ZigBee or Z-Wave).\n\nTaking this condition into consideration, can you recommend me some Hub, or give some advice regarding Smart Home Systems?", "https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/bhkikm/best_smart_home_hub_concerning_security/", 6, 19, "smarthome", "privacy", {"eltlz6k": ["Shit this guy is onto us.

What are your plans for battery powered devices? Old-skool 433Mhz stuff is terribly unreliable, especially in large homes. Anything WiFi is going to have utter shit battery life. Z-wave is far superior for battery powered devices, with ZigBee and Thread being close behind. WiFi is terrible, it takes 1-3 seconds to connect, using a crapton of battery in the process. \n\nThe fastest I've seen a WiFi chip wake, transmit and return to sleep is 770ms. This is ridiculously slow compared to Z-wave's \\~10ms. Not only are WiFi chips awake a lot longer, they also use a lot more power during the wake. Go find me a WiFi motion sensor that can transmit hundreds of detections per day for over a year on a single battery. You won't because such a thing does not exist and literally can not exist because WiFi simply uses too much power.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; On the other hand, if you get a great WiFi setup, all your other regular WiFi devices (I.e. Phones, tablets, laptops, TV, speakers, smart watches, etc.) all can benefit from it as well. \n\nYou can do this without wasting 30+ Z-wave repeater nodes and have both good WiFi AND a solid Z-wave mesh. Then your phones and laptops work great AND you can get a bunch of power-sipping Z-wave battery powered devices and have them actually able to work properly since your mesh is super solid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd lastly, Z-wave stuff doesn't need some app on a phone to set up. There's tons of posts here about people with their random Chinese WiFi shit that needs an app to get connected to WiFi, and said app is no longer available. If you're lucky, you can open the device and find some UART connectors and flash a new firmware. Often they're glued shut and you're SOL and the device is garbage. \n\nEven beyond needing a app to set up most of these things, there's the issue of needing a 2.4Ghz 802.11b/g/n network for them. What are your plans for 10 years from now when your shiny new APs don't have these legacy standards? You gonna run a second ethernet over to each location and put the new ones next to the old ones?

Or are you gonna just put an old 2.4Ghz consumer-grade router somewhere and end up in the same spot of the dummies running the ISP routers or gaming ones.

Mesh is great if you have hard to reach places, however, every hop requires the radio to receive and retransmit the signal back out, which adds delay. If you have good WiFi setup properly blanket the coverage area, then the response time could be much faster than that of a repeated signal.\n2. A Zigbee/ZWave hub can essentially be thought of as a physical VLAN tagged port. Setting up devices in their own isolated VLAN and block out internet access is privacy steps that should be taken regardless of how things are implemented. Yes, a physical device does make it a bit easier than VLAN tagging.\n3. For my WiFi devices, most of them follow the open HomeKit standard from Apple, and does not require the vendor app on my phone. Even if the vendor goes the way of the dodos, the devices should still be able to function w/o regard for the vendor (I use should, because theoretically, the firmware could be broken AF and have a blocking call back to vendor servers before processing HomeKit API commands. Though, I highly doubt that's the case or Apple wouldn't allow them to use the HomeKit certified badge).\n4. Everything is done locally with HomeKit. Nothing have to leave my house or network for the command to be processed. I can do IFTTT if I want cloud-to-device functionality (i.e.: flash the lights if I get an email notifying me a Nigerian prince want to give me bazillion cash monies), but I can do all my automation w/o any cloud directly using HomeKit.\n\nThat all said, I do understand HomeKit devices tends to come at a premium. For example, my light switches are around $80 a pop whereas cheap WeMo are going for $40 or less, and other cheap junk from China can be had for &lt;$10. But, you get what you paid for. So, I can understand if people are on a tight budget, and aren't interested to go down a specific rabbit hole, ZWave or ZigBee is great.

The only two things coming to mind are occupancy sensor (which I\u2019ll drill holes into ceiling to do POE) and smart blinds/curtains. Since I have no POE drops near Windows at this time, I have no solution for blinds but to go with batteries. I suppose with blinds, I can wait for them to respond a little bit slower and not worry about re-association time. That said, my unscientific test for WiFi association time (I.e turn off wifi on device, turn back on and reconnect) feels almost instant, definitely less than 500ms by a far margin on some devices with newer chips. Older devices on the other hand does take their sweet ass time. Interestingly, as far as I can see in my WiFi controller, unlike my iPads and iPhones, my light switches doesn\u2019t seem to go to sleep... that would explain their near instant reaction time. \n\nRe: motion sensor; my plans are POE occupancy sensor. Don\u2019t need WiFi if they\u2019re going to be attached to fixtures like ceilings. Also save a bunch of money on hard to replace button batteries. Don\u2019t want to rip things off the wall just to replace them batteries you know. \n\nI run everything via HomeKit. No vendor app or firmware hacking required. Open standards like HomeKit (where specifications can be downloaded directly from protocol vendor) ensures cross comparability and long term support. I can VLAN block off all my IOT devices so they have no internet access and they\u2019d still functional just fine remotely. \n\nI think the WiFi advancement is the biggest issue here. That said, I\u2019m also not too worried because 1) I can install some discrete in-wall 802.11ac access points to provide legacy support while running newer access points in their traditional ceiling mounted positions. Also 2) 802.11G is likely going to stay for the foreseeable future because of all the devices that\u2019s around today.

I'm honestly not an expert at mesh based WiFi, but my understanding is that Google WiFi, Eero, and alike falls in the mesh WiFi bucket, which is a bit better than repeater based WiFi in it will automatically figure out the best route to get back to the base station (whereas traditional repeater based WiFi is fixed route).\n\nI'm more familiar with switch and AP based setup, as hard-wired connections tend to be a lot better compared to wireless in that you don't need to worry about radio frequency being repeated multiple times (which causes longer delay), which is why multi-AP style setup are generally better than wireless deployments.\n\nFor home, I use Ubiquiti, which is cheaper (~$100 per AC wave1 access point; compared to Aerohive at around $175 per AC wave1 access point), at the expense of only having community support. For work, I'd recommend the usual suspects (Aruba from HP, Meraki from Cisco, etc.) and pay an arm and a leg because the premium offers much better support that would otherwise hurt work productivity. \n\nIf you're doing a brand new home setup today, for Ubiquiti, I'd say think whether or not you want 802.11ax (WiFi 6). \n\nIf you do want 802.11ax when it becomes available, I'd recommend going with something cheap and simple as a temporary measure as Ubiquiti's 802.11ax gears aren't out yet. Assuming North American dry-wall setup, about 1000 sqft of horizontal space should get an access point in central locations that can offer a lot of line of sight. On the budget end, I like UAP-AC-Lite because at $85 USD a pop MSRP, you can get an AC AP with a marketing claim of 250 concurrent clients (should be able to do ~100 realistically without too much delay), so 2 to 3 of them for a 2000~3000 sqft house, you'd be looking at &lt; $300, which you can swap out for 802.11ax gears when those get released (sell the UAP-AC-Lite in the aftermarket later to recoupe some as well).\n\nIf you don't care about 802.11ax right now, the NanoHD ($179 MSRP) or UAP-AC-HD ($349 MSRP) both does wonders. I am using 2 NanoHD at home right now as the backbone for my 30+ light switches in the above example. I get 1ms ping from client to AP throughout the 2-floor townhouse, and get 600Mbps on SpeedTest.net from my AppleTV -- this is of course with all the light switches still being on the network supposedly slowing the network down according to Z-Wave proponents -- on my 750Mbps fibre connection. I can forgo the 150Mbps because honestly, streaming 4K contents is probably going to be the most bandwidth intensive thing that I'll be doing aside from work (hardwired server), and at 600Mbps, I can pull an entire 3-hour movie down in less than 6 minutes, so I won't be yearning for more speed. I do fully plan to switch to 802.11ax gears when they become available, because I think as I acquire even more WiFi gears moving forward, and as they gain 802.11ax support, the performance will be able to gain benefits over time. Of course, when I make this transition, I'll put my NanoHD on to aftermarket to recoup some of the expenses as well.\n\nHope this helps!", 2, "t1_enc58mr"], "enec2xs": ["&gt; I suppose with blinds, I can wait for them to respond a little bit slower and not worry about re-association time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the blinds are going to be battery powered, they need to be online and connected to WiFi in order to receive any command to raise/lower them (power hungry), or polling occasionally (slow to respond).  It's not their reconnect time that's the issue, because they receive rather than originate the commands.  It's not impossible (Blink makes it work), but it's definitely the worst-case scenario for WiFi and I suspect it's the reason most IoT blinds that can be run from battery tend to use some other wireless protocol along with a WiFi bridge.

The main issue with these devices is their \"end device aging\" value built into the Xiaomi profile.  Its basically a time out value.  In the Xiaomi world, it is much larger than it is for the 1.2HA profile.  So the Xiaomi devices don't check in as frequently as a normal 1.2HA profile device would (which is most certainly the reason these devices have incredible battery life compared to similar devices).  Zigbee HA1.2 expects devices to check in every so often (I think its 30 minutes, but don't quote me on that).  Per the HA1.2 profile standard, after 3 missed check-ins, the device is booted from the mesh and is not allowed to rejoin.  So if the end device aging is 60 minutes for xiaomi and only 30 minutes for Zigbee HA1.2, if the device checks in at 1:00, then misses at 2:00, it won't check in again until 3:00.  The zigbee HA1.2 mesh expects it to check in at 1:00, 1:30, and at 2:00.  Since it doesn't get that check in, it gets kicked off the mesh and the device needs to be repaired to the hub manually.\n\nSmartThings, several firm ware revisions ago, provided an update to the hubs to allow for the longer end aging device time out.  So if the Xiaomi device is connected to the hub directly, it can miss a checkin or two and when it comes back, the hub will still allow for it.  However, if the Xiaomi device is connected to the mesh through a repeater that follows the standard HA1.2 profile, if the Xiaomi device misses a couple of check-ins, the repeater will kick it off the mesh and the device won't come back online.\n\nAll of this is entirely independent of the device handler, you can't write a device handler to manage the protocol.

Result is you need multiple SmartApps to do what you want with any given device. I also once was advised by ST support to delete a device and re-add it to get it working. Well guess what, it was part of FOURTEEN different SmartApps. That took a damn long time, and then I had to add it back!\n\n* No real logging. You have to turn logging on BEFORE you want to see the log. So dumb. When I notice a problem I want to go see what caused it, not go turn on the log so I can see next time.\n\n* No Desktop client\n\n* ST forum users back in the day were all \"just code it yourself\" every time there was a question about how to do something no SmartApp allowed.\n\n* No integration with Mac OS, which allows tremendous superpowers.\n\n* Clunky 3rd party iTunes support\n\n* But #1: **reliability was truly terrible.** Unbelievably bad. I used ST during what was apparently the year of hell, where multiple developers for the platform all pulled their plugins in protest. (I hear this is better now but don't care, I'm done with ST.)

Nonetheless, several factors come into play that make this technology a great asset. For instance, if you have to keep checking up on your kids or elderly parents, who may not be very familiar with technology, then you will be grateful for having access to this excellent piece of technology.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Nucleus fulfills almost all the capabilities you would expect from an intercom. It comes with a modest touchscreen and a camera that allows you to make voice or video calls. Thanks to Nucleus, it\u2019s possible to communicate from one device to another, regardless of whether one of the devices is located in a separate home. Communications with phones through the app is also very much possible. What\u2019s more, Nucleus is compatible with Alexa, thereby allowing you to make calls and take advantage of Alexa\u2019s numerous capabilities using your voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompared to other smart home devices, Nucleus is a little bit expensive; however, it\u2019s cheaper and simpler to use compared to most tablets. That\u2019s mainly because it doesn\u2019t come with many of the tablet functionalities. Let you not be fooled, however, by the Alexa capabilities and big touchscreen into thinking that this is a good multitasking tool. It still remains an intercom and does what it\u2019s meant to do, even though it includes a few extras. Nonetheless, if you are certain you really need an intercom in your smart home, then it\u2019s worth giving the Nucleus a shot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Preparing For a Chat**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA simple 8-inch touchscreen and a giant camera lens means you can never go wrong with the Nucleus intercom, as far as chatting is concerned. It incorporates a stand for effortless propping up on a desk. The problem, however, is that it\u2019s difficult to adjust the stand\u2019s angle to achieve the best possible view of the room. The Nucleus can easily be mounted on the wall, thanks to the necessary brackets that it comes with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe device automatically boots up once you plug it in. You are then prompted to key in your Wi-Fi info and wait as it downloads the recent updates. Thereafter, it will take you through a brief tutorial, so you can set up your account and get right into business. For your username, you will need to enter your email. Other necessary details include a room name for the device, your family name, and your name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the verification process, you will receive a \u201cHome Code\u201d. If you set up multiple devices, you can move right ahead to keying in the room name by entering the provided code. Note that you will need more than one device, if you are looking forward to using it as an intercom system. But if you are mainly using it to check in with your kids or elderly parents, then one device is sufficient. That\u2019s because Nucleus works well with your smartphone through the Nucleus app for Android and iOS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Calling**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe primary advantage of the Nucleus over the several free chat apps available for your smartphone comes to the fore when you use the device to call another. You don\u2019t get to wait for the person on the other end to pick up before you can connect. Simply press the voice or camera icon for one device. The receiving device then automatically picks up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can have a chat with your elderly parents, check on a room, or make a quick announcement. All this is possible without the receiver touching the screen. The fact that this functionality is possible with the mobile app as well means you can remotely check on your home without requiring anybody to pick up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best thing about this feature is that you can easily turn it off if you are concerned about the privacy implications. Tap the Privacy button to change the settings, so you have to pick up to receive inbound calls. Also tap the Do Not Disturb icon if you don\u2019t wish to pick up any calls at all. There\u2019s even a physical shutter that easily slides over the camera if you\u2019d like to be 100 percent certain about your privacy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalling from the Nucleus device to a smartphone, on the other hand, is not instant. The call won\u2019t even go through if the app on your cell phone is closed. You can only be notified of an incoming call when the Nucleus app is open, even in the background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Remote Connection**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemote connection allows you to get in touch with other Nucleus users. However, remote connections don\u2019t connect instantly, and don\u2019t give you access to all the devices in your home. In settings, it\u2019s possible to send a unique code to a friend via email to share an individual device. Once your friend feeds in the code, you\u2019ll be asked to approve the connection, after which you can see each other via the remote tab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Quality of the Call**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore often than not, the clarity of sound and video when making a call largely depends on the stability and speed of your internet connection. Nevertheless, you can never get crystal-clear HD even when the device is at its best. The connection is, however, serviceable, and you will be able to hear and see what\u2019s happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Verdict**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are only interested in purchasing the Nucleus Smart Home Intercom just for the touchscreen, the Ring (which surrounds the massive camera lens), or Alexa, then you\u2019ve got it all wrong. The truth is that even if you factor in these features together with its prime function of making and receiving video calls, you still get a device that does not outdo a smartphone in terms of its usefulness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, if you have kids or elderly parents that you always want to check up on, especially if the auto-answer feature would be exceptionally useful, then purchasing this device makes a lot more sense. Furthermore, the additional integrations qualify it as a pretty solid purchase.\n\nSource:[https://techsmartest.com/nucleus-smart-home-intercom-review/](https://techsmartest.com/nucleus-smart-home-intercom-review/)", "https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/aqfv7y/nucleus_smart_home_intercom_review/", 1, 1, "smarthome", "privacy", {"eggc3or": ["This is still around?

The bulb I use doesn't require a hub like Philips Hue, but I'm familiar with the 2 different technologies that hubs can use. I'm also aware that they minimize the strain on a router and make it easier to connect many devices together. \n\nSo I'm wondering if there's anything I can get later in the future that could do the same thing once I have more devices. I plan on having 2 bulbs, and 2 LED strips in my room eventually. My internet connection is DSL which is pretty unfortunate but I've not had many issues with my light disconnecting. Only on occasions when my power goes out or something which a quick on/off of my lamp gets things working again. I'd like to use the same bulbs for everything because I don't want to deal with using multiple apps, and I don't want to get an Echo or Home device for privacy reasons. Hopefully there's some device that can bridge all of these devices without me needing to buy all new bulbs as I really like the functionality and apps of my current bulb.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and offer any advice if you do.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/bwjqbu/a_question_about_hubs/", 9, 28, "smarthome", "privacy", {"epzk1sw": ["I'm in the middle of a fair sized city.

The other purchase would be the thermostat to save money on electricity all while keeping it comfortable for everyone.\n\nThoughts? Is Nest a better option long term? My job uses Nest and Yale keys at our office and I love the security system. Which is why I wanted to do the smart home anyways.\n", "https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/ahju2k/new_home_whats_the_most_needed_smart_home_item/", 1, 9, "smarthome", "security", {"eekvhn6": ["Our absolute favorite is the Chamberlain MyQ garage door opener.

", 2, "t3_ahju2k"], "eei5b0a": ["A great website to purchase from is Techqore they have all the new smart home stuff. they sell at really good prices I got all my smart home security from there. \n\n[Techqore.com](https://techqore.myshopify.com/)", 2, "t3_ahju2k"], "eehloir": ["Welcome to home automation! A lot of things arent exactly the most aesthetically pleasing. Smart plugs can be bulky, smart bulb switches may have to be installed alongside your existing switches, and tons of small plastic boxes for hubs and sensors. Generally you can hide most of them (hubs in a network closet/cabnet, plugs behind furniture, custom wall plates to integrate smart bulb switches better) but the ones where you can't, the convenience factor heavily outweighs any \"ugly factor\" for me.  \n\nNest thermostat is about the same in terms of functionality as the Ecobee now that Nest has temperature sensors too so that's no big change. Not sure if older models are compatible with them or not, they're pretty new. \n   \nIf you plan on sticking with August smart locks, they are retrofitted to existing locks. If you're changing the locks to one that's compatable, it's not a huge deal. If you were set on getting something like a Schlage smart lock that replaces the existing lock, it would be a waste of money to have to replace the locks twice.", 2, "t1_eehf8ax"], "eefdqrp": ["This is a lot longer than I expected but I covered the very basics. There is a lot out there and with proper automation software, your imagination and budget are the limit. I've tried to keep things on the practical side.   \n     \nMost value would be smart thermostat but it isn't what I would buy first. First thing I'd look at are the various home automation hub software like Smartthings, Home Assistant, or Homekit. This way, if you do decide to have some automation/control between devices, they will be compatible. Since you have a majority of apple products, Homekit, is a good choice. I have no experience with Homekit but I see it recommended for Apple households. I personally use Home Assistant because I don't have any Apple products and it has really broad compatibility. The down side is it has a very steep learning curve. If you plan on using a voice assistant, make sure your devices are compatible. Automation software, like IFTTT, Stringify, Home Assistant, etc, is also something to keep in mind. A lot of my most useful smart home functionality comes from automation software.    \n      \nI'd do the locks first, since you should be changing them anyway when you buy a new house. I prefer ones with external key pads so I can give temporary access with a code if someone needs to watch my house while I'm away and I don't have to worry about keys (I still carry one just in case the keypad dies but it usually gives you ample warning). I think they have a separate keypad for August. Not sure though. You may have to worry about people losing the smart key if you have to worry about them losing regular keys so a keypad is another plus here.     \n           \nIf you plan on getting a home security system right away, then get that next. No point in buying something that you plan to replace and have to change out all the sensors. I didn't plan on getting one so I can't really recommend any tips for this one. If your home security systems of choice doesn't have leak sensors, pick up compatible ones. They're great for avoiding water damage. This is more important for leaky basements but useful for under sinks and sump pumps too. Smart Smoke detectors might fall under this category too. I know nest makes one. Not sure if there are other good ones. Having these connected to smart bulbs/switches is good for waking people up in an emergency.       \n      \nIf you don't plan on getting a home security system right away, then go smart thermostat instead. The only difference between the Ecobee 4 and Ecobee 3 is the built in Alexa. If you plan on getting into Alexa devices, then the 4 is a good choice. Otherwise go with the 3. They're usually around the same price. Nest has sensors now if you prefer Nest. I prefer the Ecobee, but if you're going Nest security system, might as well go Nest for the thermostat too.    \n          \nAfter that I'd start on lights. Video doorbells are nice but you'll get more use out of lights. You don't have to do them all in one go. Wait for sales and add them as needed. Decide if you want smart bulbs or smart switches.   \n       \nSmart bulbs are easier to install and offer color. I prefer Hue bulbs since they're compatible with most smart devices and hubs. I have color Hues in my entertainment areas since I find that dark blues and purples reduce glare on the TV the most. They have warmer oranges too which I use before going to sleep to help me relax. Colors are in the bedroom too for the same reason. I have white bulbs in places I don't need color like hallways, bathrooms, outside, and the basement. I try to stay away from wifi bulbs so they don't congest my network. It should be fine if you have a few but 30+ might be too much for your router. I have an 1800sq 2 story house with a basement and detached garage. I have 35 and counting smart bulbs. They add up fast.          \n    \nSmart switches are harder to install because they completely replace the old switches but they're easier to use since they work like regular switches. Most people on this sub prefer smart switches. I use smart bulbs because I like color so I can't make any recommendation on switches.   \n      \nAt the same time as lights, look at smart plugs for anything that can't be automated by bulbs or switches. They're also useful for in-window air conditioners, indoor Chirstmas lights, small lamps, etc. Pretty much anything that will be 'on' if it is unplugged and plugged back in. If you use it for space heaters, make sure to check the maximum wattage rating of the plug first.      \n    \nRobo vacuums are handy for daily vacuuming but you will still need to run a manual one every few weeks. They do help keep dirt to a minimum though. I usually have mine run when I'm at work and clean out it's bin when I get home. Just make sure it has nothing to get stuck on when it runs. I'd get these after everything above though.       \n   \nDoorbell is the last think I'd get. its useful but less so than the other things on the list. I haven't gotten one so I have no recommendations or tips.", 1, "t3_ahju2k"], "eehf8ax": ["So realistically after my wife looked at the devices... she thinks we go with a Nest Security system and a Nest Thermostat first.

The Echo Dot has native support for the smart plug, but the smart extension lead requires a third party app called Smart Life to be used to setup an account, and link that to Alexa. I think the plug is by Tuya. I already don't like the messing around with the Smart Life app, and would rather just have everything as simple as it can be.\n\nI would like to progress into smart lighting, security such as door/window contacts, cameras, thermostats etc. but figured lighting is the best place to start. I originally looked at Philips Hue, but they are pretty expensive and require their own hub (unless you get an Echo + which acts as a Zigbee hub from what i've read). I want to avoid having multiple hubs, but also where possible having hubs/devices that are reliant upon the cloud. I have already read about SmartThings going down and maintenance causing outages for people's smart homes - not cool.\n\nSo if anyone can help me figure out what I am best doing, please let me know. If anyone can also explain how the plugs I have connect to Alexa, that would be appreciated.\n\nI have listed some things below that I have read about and my thoughts on them:\n\nSmartThings - good idea in principle (support for ZWave and Zigbee), but the cloud communication is a drawback\nHome Assistant - good idea, but how does it work with voice control, and how difficult is it to integrate everything into one app?\nLightwaveRF - better concept than smart light bulbs and smart plugs, but very expensive and even if I got an Echo Plus, I would still need the LightwaveRF bridge?\nHive - Not as much support for light bulb styles as Philips Hue, but much cheaper and also has a product range with cameras, leak sensors, thermostat etc.\nPhilips Hue - good quality, basically the most iconic smart light bulb, but expensive. Only integrates with Nest (which I know little about).", "https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/ac7yxl/new_to_smarthome_need_help/", 1, 8, "smarthome", "security", {"ed5vf3a": ["Don't let the cloud implementation of Smartthings deter you. I've been using it for over 2 years with over 60 devices connected to it and it works better than I could have ever asked for. I'd say it's up and running as it should 99% of the time. There other 1% are small outages, mostly less than half an hour. Many of them are planned outages that are announced through email. Trust me, the cloud has not been a negative for me at all. ", 1, "t3_ac7yxl"], "ed5xghi": ["Welcome to the smart home world! As you can see, it's a bit of a mess at the moment. I would highly recommend that you select a hub now and stick to devices it supports, as well as avoiding Wifi-based devices like the ones you have mentioned. Smart Things and Home Assistant are two great options. SmartThings cloud isn't ideal, but I have found it to be relatively reliable and lag-free, personally. Home Assistant is more powerful and local, but don't underestimate the setup time required. It's a massive investment of time and effort. To your question, once set up everything will be available on a single webpage, and you can customize that further as needed. I found the voice control options to be a hassle and not work very well. They want to sell you their cloud subscription. If you don't mind a monthly sub, it's pretty hassle-free from what I hear.\n\nHue is great. Yes, it's expensive, but it's also a very high quality and well supported ecosystem. It also works great with most hubs, so you can control your Hue lights via HA, ST, etc. Ikea Tradfri is a nice Zigbee-based option if you're looking to save a few bucks.\n\nEcho Plus is a very limited hub. I would avoid it. It will not compare to ST or HA in terms of features, compatibility, etc. Let Echo act as your voice assistant, and get a proper hub to do the heavy lifting. It's also 100% reliant on the cloud. While ST will lose some functionality without internet, a lot of stuff is locally controlled and will still work. Not the case with Echo (though Echo plus may have local support I'm not aware of).\n\nIn terms of protocol, each has it's own pros and cons. Wifi is good for entry level because it does not require a hub, but the downsides are many. Wifi isn't a protocol that handles a lot of traffic well and most wifi devices will require a native app or use the cloud. Zigbee and Z-Wave are both mesh networks designed for home automation. As a result they tend to be more reliable, lower bandwidth and require less electricity (important for wireless devices). They're also both mesh networks, so devices that you add increase the range of your communication network. Between the two, Zigbee devices tend to be a bit less standardized, and cheaper. Z-Wave has the added benefit of being on a separate frequency (Zigbee shares the 2.4ghz band of Wifi), but will generally cost the most out of the three protocols. Most hubs will support all protocols, including ST and HA (with appropriate dongles).", 1, "t3_ac7yxl"], "ed5y5li": ["I find myself switching from Smartthings (ST) and Home Assistant (HA) every two years or so, (just switched back to ST), and I'll paraphrase the old Windows/Linux conclusion:\n\nHome Assistant is the way you should go if you want a hobby. It ticks pretty much every single box you want:\n\n* You can design your own interface\n* You can get USB dongles for ZWave/Zigbee so you don't have hubs lying about\n* Works with tons of stuff and more gets added all the time\n* Runs locally\n* Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (I can only speak about the latter)\n   * Note: Costs $5/mo unless you set it up yourself\n* However:\n   * Presence detection is very flaky.\n\nIt's really comprehensive, cheap, versatile, and powerful. It's also a humongous time sink. They're getting MUCH better about it \"just working\" so I'm probably being a little harsher than they warrant if we extrapolate into the future, but this is not really going to be something you just set up and it works. Please note: I used HA and considered this a positive trait-- I *like* tinkering-- I'm just making you aware. Presence detection is very painful because there isn't a cross-platform native mobile app, like ST has, so you rely on all sorts of other methods, which I've found to be quite flaky even with their cool bayesian logic stuff. Nothing makes your wife look at you like you're an idiot like all the lights turning off during dinner because HA thought everyone left for 30 seconds, haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmartthings, on the other hand, just works, but is less versatile, powerful and customizable, and while it works with *a lot*, it doesn't come close to what HA supports. If you go this route, look into WebCore, which is how automation should have been handled by ST natively, but for reasons I really can't understand, isn't. It's the only reason I even entertain using ST at all, simplicity be damned. Presence detection, because of their cross-platform phone app, is pretty reliable. I also have some concerns with Samsungs takeover of ST; I'm not sure what's going on but they now have TWO phone apps and they don't have feature parity. Another thing, more of a note, is that ST-branded components are usually pretty expensive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, since you're just starting out, if you're still on the fence, I'd suggest going with HA first because of the low barrier to entry (A raspberry pi and an SD card \\~ $40) and if you go to buy components, at first, just make sure ST supports it, too. (There's several cool things you can do with a Raspberry Pi, if HA isn't your thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, and one last thing: Phillips Hue integrates with more than nest. In fact, I didn't even know it integrated with Nest.  It integrates with ST, HA, Logitech Harmony, IFTTT, Alexa, and Google Assistant off the top of my head. They are expensive, though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this wasn't a rambling mess!", 1, "t3_ac7yxl"], "ed5z8dw": ["Not at all, that was a great reply.\n\nI saw HA and noticed that it would be a tinkerers dream.

I\u2019ve done this in the past with Subsonic (essentially a local version of Spotify), and while I enjoyed the challenge, I didn\u2019t like the fact I\u2019d wasted a month of my life getting it set up to only find it didn\u2019t work perfectly, and the mess of moving back to using iTunes.\n\nAm I correct in saying both HA and ST support both Zigbee and ZWave? \n\nI will look into HA also and see if it\u2019s going to be worth my time.

There is a native iOS app that performs presence detection. My biggest personal gripe with HA besides presence detection is that I, for some reason, really, really, really hate writing automations in yaml. I installed Node Red to handle that functionality, and it worked great-- but guides on how to use it were not very common, so I had to learn the old fashioned way-- trial and error. It may be better now, but even without Node Red, HA will work-- don't doubt that.\n\nST does support both protocols, as does HA with the caveat that you have to buy hardware for the RPi to get it. They both have USB dongles for this. \n\nIt's only my opinion, but when it comes to central hubs, ST and HA are the only real choices. It so happens that's also the only things I've used, so take that with a grain of salt. Either one is a good choice, as long as you know what you're getting in to.\n\nAs an aside, if you set up Subsonic and run pihole, you're probably going to have no trouble with HA.

Because people can create their own device handlers and smart apps the list of supported devices is massive, comparable only to Home Assistant. WebCoRE is a smartapp that allows complex automations, and is also highly recommended. One of the key ST things that's not well explained is the difference between versions of the hub and app. For the hub, v2 is technically more powerful than v3, and includes a built-in battery backup. v3, on the other hand, can sometimes be cheaper, and adds wifi support. Note that in this case that means the hub can be connected via wifi instead of ethernet. I DO NOT recommend using wifi, as that will add a layer of unreliability to all of your smart home stuff that you want to avoid. If you can live with a wired connection, and can find the v2 hub for a comparable/cheaper price to v3, it's recommended to do so. For the app, the new SmartThings app is still in development and is fairly limited. You should download the SmartThings Classic app and use that instead. If you go with a v3 hub you'll need the new app to pair to the hub, but after that you can switch.\n\nI'm not well versed in IFTTT since I've got a proper hub in place.

I was actually thinking about security systems at the time, so I listed to him.  One of the things I asked was what would happen if we had to relocate due to a job change.  I knew at the time that there was a pretty good chance that we would have to move due to my wife's work.  He told me it would be no problem and we could cancel.  He also said that the security system would help when we go to sell the house and that the new owner could simply take over the account.\n\nFast forward 3 years from then (2016) and sure enough, we had to move for my wife's work.  So the new home buyer said he would take over the system and I called vivint to see what I needed to do to make that happen.  They made it sound like they just needed the new buyer to contact them and setup the account.  I passed the info on to the realtor and dealt with all the other home selling/moving related issues I had to deal with at that time.\n\nUnfortunately, we closed on the house and the new buyer never followed through with the takeover.  So at that point, I had no access to the house and couldn't get the equipment out.  I tried through the realtor to get the system components, but the new buyer never responded to the realtor.\n\nYou would think at that point, after explaining the situation to Vivint that they might be a little sympathetic.  Not at all.  Even though their website at the time stated that they understand life happens and you may need to cancel under certain circumstances, they wouldn't budge.  Basically said we were on the hook for the remaining $1,200 left on the contract.  I actually continued to pay on the account for almost a year after moving because I didn't know what to do.  We moved into a rental unit, which, of course, doesn't want some crappy vivint system.  So I had no way to transfer the account.\n\nAfter a certain point, I just couldn't justify paying $49.99 a month for something that I'm not able to use.  So I just stopped paying.  They sent it to collections, and now, in 2018, I get a ding on my credit for it.\n\nImagine I come to your house and knock on your door and offer to mow your grass for 60 months @ $50 per month.  You agree, and then 3 years into our agreement, you get relocated to a NYC apartment (no grass).  Then I come after you for $1,200 which is what you would have had to pay me over the next 2 years for mowing your grass.  Sound fair?\n\nThat's exactly what Vivint did.  They expected to be paid for services they didn't render.  I didn't agree to pay them $3,000 over 60 months for no reason.  I expected something in return for that money.  Once they could no longer fulfill their side of the agreement, why do they think they're entitled to free money?  \n\nThankfully, when I signed the agreement I refused to sign up for automatic payments.  They sales guy was pushy about this, but I finally told him that if he insisted that I give him my CC# the deal was off.  He agreed to alter the contract on the spot and hand wrote on the agreement that I would be billed monthly.  So they never got authorization for automatic drafts from my bank/cc.  They were pushy about this for the next 3 years too.  I had to be really careful not to agree to automatic payments.  Thank god I never did that because I've read all the reviews where they continue to auto draft people even after the contract is cancelled.\n\nAnyway, their billing department is completely incompetent and useless.  They will hold you to the payment agreement no matter what happens to you.  Dealing with them is the worst experience I've ever had with a business.  By far the worst customer service experience I've ever encountered.\n\nMultiple state attorney generals have settlements against vivint for their business practices.  I've contacted mine to see if there is any help they can provide.  I do live in a state where they had a settlement last year.  Unfortunately for me, I was never notified about it, and I just learned about the settlement recently.  \n\nI really hope karma comes knocking for these scammers.  The number of people they've ripped off and put through hell is astounding.  They shouldn't be allowed to operate a lemonade stand, let alone a large security company.\n\nI beg anyone reading this to never, ever do business with vivint in any way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nF vivint", "https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/ajcs3h/stay_away_from_vivint/", 1, 42, "smarthome", "security", {"eeug9mw": ["&gt;\\&gt; Imagine I come to your house and knock on your door and offer to mow your grass for 60 months @ $50 per month.

The other way, if I enter with the door open, the light won't power on. There could be many other variables happening during the day also.\n\nSo I saw the aqara motion sensor, to power on and off lights when I'm actually or not in the room. The thing is, I don't know how this sensor works. Does it only detect movement? So that if I stay still in my room for a while it will power off lights? Does it recognize me instantly?

Having said that, in my mind they're quite pricey and still a beta product. I would wait a few years or build your own unless you don't mind the cost.\n* Install many more PIR sensors than you think you need, so you capture any movement in the room, and set a long timeout so lights never shut off prematurely (e.g.: \\~15 mins for restrooms, 1-2 hours for your living room, etc.)\n* DIY: Add sensors that don't require LoS (line of sight) to the detector, like the cheap radar sensors you can buy today (e.g.: RCWL-0516 which is $0.5). These have some issues with false-positives and are totally DIY, but they have great potential when used with classic PIR sensors to keep the lights on (they react to very small movements like magic, but require more power than PIRs so can't be battery powered).\n* DIY: Count people entering and leaving using 2 PIR in a quadrature layout (arguably one of the very best solutions to presence, but I'm not aware of any commercial solution on the market).\n* DIY: BLE presence detection via tracking phones or BLE tags - seems really cool, but I think it's not reliable enough to be used for real-time detection.\n* Explicit detection hacks:\n   * In a restroom: attach a simple door sensor to the lid of your toilet, so your automation can tell when the seat is up and keep the lights on.\n   * In a bedroom: add strain guages (weight sensors) to the foot of your bed, so you can tell if there's no-one / a pet / a person / multiple people on the bed (possibly even say who is there if your weights differ enough)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", 1, "t3_b06gdd"], "eicj2ay": ["I wasn't clear\nI meant when the 30mins are up does the light shuts off for a moment to then light up again?

First, your ethernet runs are probably the #1 thing to worry about right now.  Also wiring for smart blinds if you may want them eventually - cheaper to do it at studs than at completion.  Most of the other smart products are really designed to go in existing houses - smart switches and outlets wire up the same as their modern dumb counterparts, doorbell camera will use a standard 12v doorbell transformer, etc.  Unfortunately a lot of consumer-level surveillance products are wifi only, so there's no way to hardwire - although some people still do use PoE to power them.  But if you go with something a bit more prosumer (like Ubiquiti's solutions), you'll find full ethernet options (trust me, sharing your wifi bandwidth with a bunch of always-streaming cameras sucks.)\n\nMy house was rewired 20 years ago with double runs of cat 5e, forward thinking, but I'm already thinking about what it will take to rewire it again eventually  The second run was just for telephony, but thank god it's there - I'm in the process of converting them to Ethernet terminations, for a Ubiquiti wifi network.\n\nSo, I would look at doing double runs of Cat 6 to not only each room, but also a ceiling box for wifi APs in whatever rooms you'll want them.  Ceiling wifi has less chance of being obstructed by furniture.\n\nSmart outlets are pricey as hell, if you're doing a whole home.  My house has like 70 duplex outlets.

Smartthings (mostly) requires internet to work, but is overall inexpensive and works great from my two years of experience. I personally use a majority of z-wave devices for my apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you don't need ambient light changes, or color options, then I would go with smart switches. Z-Wave smart switches are $30-$50 and offer high quality hardware that works *locally only.* This is nice because you won't have a bunch of random devices that *need* internet to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCameras are another thing. Nest, Ring, and Arlo all have superior motion detection compared to the more traditional camera systems. If that portion is important, proceed. However, you can get hardwired cameras that work *locally* so you don't need to rely on internet or wifi for those important moments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I think if someone is going to own their house and is seriously looking at this space they need to start with an overall view of where they want to go. If you just want to do a few outlets and such, do whatever. If you want to eventually automate the whole house then you should start with a *local first, internet second*  approach to properly protect your investments.", 20, "t1_eow2wx4"], "eow2wx4": ["Aww come on!

Some of these might be controversial (AI/machine learning) so you might disagree:\n\n* Always up to date. Even if you run your own solution and create an easily upgradable solution with docker, there'll be a point where you focus on something else, get a bit bored, forget, and the release will slip.\n* Part of a large ecosystem. This is the promise of the cloud and I find it mostly delivers. Devices and services inter-operate in the cloud and it's not managed by you. For example, if my \"weather\" provider changes their API, I don't care, the nest engineers take care of that and always show me the correct weather. \n* Data analysis. Your data is collected, aggregated and analyzed. This can be used to generate models and learn your habits and the intricacies of your home. For example, how much cool air remains in your ducts given a specific outside weather determines how long the fan should run after the cooling compressor has stopped. It can also be used for electric savings by partnering with a local energy provider\n* It just works.

This is especially true for devices that are annoying to replace and might even require a professional. Some ideas I'd like to see in the future.\n\n* Local WiFi API for devices. I'm OK if it's not standardized at first but give me a way to query sensors and perform basic operations on the device. For Nest, that'd be polling the mechanic status, temperature sensors, and activating various functions. No presence detection, weather, smart fans cycles, or even advanced programming. This is something that could be implemented ASAP. Doesn't need to be HTTPS, doesn't need to have a complicated access key (Serial should be enough?). Simple enough so it can be reliable and accessible.\n* DIRECT integration with 3rd party. I'm OK if there are no data standards beyond encapsulation here as well. i.e: use JSON but don't define all the parameter names in an industry-wide agreement. This would let me buy a Nest and integrate it with any websites that share a common API to send and receive data.

Maybe I just want things to work and make the device communicate DIRECTLY with Amazon (Not via backend-backend integration)\n   * Let's manufacturer not care about building, maintaining, and operating a cloud solution. I'm thinking Chamberlain is not thrilled at creating their own cloud/app/support for a garage opener with 2 states and 2 operations. I think a lot more devices would be \"smart\" if all they had to do is import a library and add a $5 chip that does the WiFi and communicates with the existing I2C chip. Think an ESP8266 with an open-source firmware that can be configured to read from I2C and write to the WiFi.

Though it's the wrong time of year, getting a smart plugs for holiday lights is another good project. Having them all on and off at the same time, is super satisfying. \n\nHUBS: Checkout SmartThings, Wink, Apple HomeKit, Amazon Echo/Alexa, Google Home.  SmartThings and Wink are good it you want to control the system through a phone app.  Amazon Echo is great for voice control, and it can work with Wink/SmartThings or serve as a hub - however their phone app sucks. That said, voice control is the killer app of home automation, and most of the new devices coming on the market are Echo/Alexa compatible.  It's as safe a bet as there is.\n\nDEVICES: Once you know what hub/tech you're going with, check that services site for compatible products. When possible, buy items that are Zwave compatible. Most hubs support Zwave, so even if you switch your controlling hub later, you shoulnd't have to replace all your devices. GE's newer plugs seem to be pretty solid, but you can get by with cheaper Chinese ones if you're just playing around.\n\nSPEAKERS AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT: Logitech Harmony Home Ultimate is pretty solid for home entertainment control.  They have a basic hub, and also play well with others (Wink, Echo, etc.).  This could be a way to automate your home entertainment without buying new equipment.  SONOS is my personal favorite for speakers, and some of their newer models have some limited Alexa capability built in. \n\nADD-ON SERVICES: There are some other services that can help tie together different echosystems.

", 1, "t3_abhqxv"], "ed1dgw7": ["Let me shed some light on this for you as to what's happening and why.  WARNING!  LONG POST!\n\nEach device needs its own IP address, but since these are scarce (for IPv4), we use something called NAT (Network Address Translation).  Basically, the \"router\" gets the one real IP address and everything behind it gets a private address that can't route to the Internet.  When a device with a private address makes a connection to the Internet, the router makes the connection itself and records the port numbers of the source and destination devices in a table.  From that point on, it translates the addresses on all the packets based on the port numbers used in the table.\n\nFor incoming connections, you must go into the router and set up what incoming ports should be forwarded to which machines.  So, if you want HTTP to come in, you set which internal machine should get all incoming requests for port 80 (http).  You can also set a \"DMZ\" address (De-Militarized Zone), basically a catch-all for all other requests not forwarded somewhere else.   If you don't set up port forwarding or a DMZ, then you get NO INCOMING CONNECTIONS!  That's right.  Hackers can't reach all the lights and switches or get into your network at all.  Only what you forward comes in and only to the device you forward to.\n\nSo ... how can Google Assistant, Alexa, IFTTT, and the like turn on your lights?  These services do all processing in the cloud.  Your phone and smart speakers and displays don't have a million protocols built-in to access every manufacturer's smart system.  These services have no idea if your IP address is dynamic and might change, and they can't make an incoming connection to your network anyway!  \n\nWhat happens is that your devices make an *outgoing* connection (supported by the NAT technology) to a 3rd party server and identifies themselves using your account information, then holds the connection open.  Google, Alexa, IFTTT, and whoever can then contact the 3rd party server (which has a nice fixed IP address), authenticate themselves using OAUTH to get permission to control the devices connected to your account, and can send commands through the 3rd party server back through the connections the devices made out through your router.   This is why some people don't like direct WiFi devices and prefer a hub since you have a limit in the router's connection table.  However, that limit is over 65 thousand connections!  You'll be good for awhile!\n\nYour security issues have nothing to do with your router, and VLANs and all that are going to net you absolutely nothing.  The vulnerability will be with the security of the 3rd party server and the possibility that the devices and apps might be leaking information out of your network to the 3rd party server.  Connections aren't coming in!  If you are worried that these devices are snooping your network and reporting back, don't use unencryoted protocols, and you can VPN if worried about the leakage of metadata, but ... stick the questionable stuff on the guest network if you are worried.  That normally prevents direct access between devices. In most cases you'll need to put your phone on the guest network to set up the devices, and maybe to use the branded app, but your Google/Alexa/IFTTT connections should work fine and if the app supports viewing/changing the devices from the Internet, then it will work as well!\n\nAlso, you CAN get rid of that broadlink app and control the device from a local server.  This basically cuts off access from outside the house, including all your Assistants.   What I've done for my own network is to use a dynamic DNS for incoming connections and then use IFTTT to glue various Google Assistant phrases to the \"Webhook\" module.   This requires a port forward for incoming connections from IFTTT to my server (a BeagleBone Black) which are done over SSL and use a password in the POST body.  I'll likely reflash my Sonoff devices to keep those local, but I don't know about my WiFi bulbs yet.   I'd need to investigate the protocols being used and see if I can control those locally.  I'm just not there with my software yet, but the IFTTT/Webhook bridge gives me fine-grained control over what comes in to the broadlink and prevents anything going out.\n", 1, "t3_abhqxv"], "ed1e2kv": ["Homebridge only for ios right?

You then register with something like duckdns and forward incoming connections to whatever control your blackbean.   Pop over to IFTTT and set up an applet that says \"if this ...\" select Google Assistant and what phrase you want to say, \"then that ...\" select Webhooks and put in your duckdns address and whatever URL parameters it needs.   This means that Google Assistant will talk to IFTTT as your 3rd party server, and the IFTTT applets filter the triggers you want onto your network.\n\nThere are other ways of integrating with Google Assistant, but IFTTT is pretty easy to set up.  The only drawback is you give up natural language processing.  You get 3 variants of your trigger phrase.  With the backend I use (custom - https://github.com/uudruid74/RestHome), I can say \"Hey Google, start the movie\" and it plays a macro that switches the input, sets the sound processing mode on the AV, turns down the lights and hits \"play\" on the bluray all using a single IFTTT applet, but I do end up needing a LOT of these!", 1, "t1_ed1g0is"], "ed1lq9s": ["Usually ask the vendor. :)", 1, "t1_ed1dr8c"], "ed2je0d": ["The Unify Security Gateway is a pretty nice interface for the average joe to be able to properly setup a segmented network.", 1, "t1_ed1jaq7"], "ed0fmgq": ["Care to elaborate what that means?

I figured this was the time to add a meaningful whole house audio system with in-ceiling speakers.

I'd love any advice or thoughts on the best way to accomplish this scenario:\n\n**Basic Layout:**\n\n* Front porch: 2 in-ceiling outdoor speakers + wall control switch\n* Dining room: 2 in-ceiling speakers  +  Echo dot + wall control switch\n* Kitchen: 2 in-ceiling speakers +  Echo dot + wall control switch\n* Living Room: 2 in-ceiling speakers for the TV and a subwoofer hidden in the wall. +  Echo dot + wall control switch\n* Back Porch: 2 in-ceiling outdoor speakers  + wall control switch\n\n**Desired Use Cases:**\n\n* I'd like a direct input from each room that has an Echo Dot into the main system to use its built-in mic. The entire whole house audio system would always be default on to the Alexa channel. So if I'm in a room with Alexa, I say 'play xyz song' or 'turn on lights' and I'd hear the response throughout the whole house system that was currently switched on.\n* It would be slightly inconvenient I think to have each Echo channel go to the whole system, but the living room/dining room/kitchen are all very open so not a big deal to me. And the two outdoor speaker sets could always have the volume knob off by default.\n* I'd also like to be able to swap the whole house system input from the Alexa channel to the Apple TV/Airplay channel (ideally via the Harmony app or even better, by a button on the wall control switch). That way for example, I could be outside on the porch, flip the speaker to the Airplay channel and airplay a song from my phone (instead of having an Alexa outside as the input.). Basically the 3 Echo's would be 'split' into one A channel ideally, and my B channel would be the Apple TV. \n* We also have satellite Echo Plus speakers we'd put in a room or two upstairs. (I don't want to wire in-ceiling speakers  there) that way, if we really wanted the music to 'sync' we could use the multi-room Alexa feature for that one-off speaker.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* What kind of home audio amp/controller/switch should we use? Should we have 3/8\" jack input/USB power plates added to each room to plug the Alexa into? Is there a better way?\n* What do y'all think of having the Alexa's always on (privacy concerns aside) and plugged into the main speakers downstairs that is always on? Is there a better way? I am okay controlled the audio each room with a switch, but if there was an app-based way I'd prefer that.\n* Has anyone seen a writeup on have personal experience with this?

I want an open source security system that can leverage modern machine learning and deep learning to detect cars, people, dogs, or any object for which I have annotated data to train! \n\nI have installed and tested several open source camera systems (Zoneminder, Kerberos.io, Shinobi, Motion), but they are either difficult to setup, don't address privacy concerns, consume way too many resources, use weird open source licenses (free/pro versions), or don't have a plugin architecture that supports developers contributing new vision algorithms. For an in-depth review of these projects see Jason Antman's blog post ([https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation/](https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation/)).\n\nMy initial goal is develop a software architecture that allows for the processing and monitoring of multiple cameras with modern computer vision algorithms with the assumption that these algorithms will advance over time. The architecture should support local processing on small embedded systems (Raspberry PI, laptops, etc.) or private cloud processing. Currently, systems like the Raspberry PI may not be able to use deep neural network models, but companies like NVIDIA, Intel, and Amazon are trying to develop small USB sticks that can efficiently run deep learned models. This architecture should not just be limited to monocular camera systems; why not make use of RGB-D sensors (e.g., Microsoft Kinect) or stereo-vision systems? I will also create an API that allows other home automation systems (e.g., Home Assistant, IFTTT, etc.) to use this new vision system.\n\nI am a roboticist at a major research university and I have a lot of experience with computer vision, robot motion planning, and reinforcement learning, so I understand the technical issues that need to be addressed. Everything that I write will be licensed under GPLv3 and won't limit any features based on any \"pro\" versions. However, I may be able to financially support this project by packaging and selling embedded cameras and single-board computers (Raspberry PI). I fully expect many DIYers to download the software and run it for free on their own systems, but I expect many people will want to just purchase a working system in order to save time. \n\nI became a roboticist because I wanted to bring helpful and safe robots into my own home, so this project may just be the first step towards enabling home robots by providing situational awareness through vision systems.\n\nI'm going to leverage many common open source projects for the algorithmic heavy lifting: OpenCV 4, TensorFlow, and ROS.

Milestone 1 is mostly just live viewing / viewing of recorded footage of ONVIF or RTSP video streams and Hikvision and Uniview manufacturer's cameras APIs calls for camera names and controls. (Axis and Dahua has also contributed their APIs recently, but we have not yet implemented them -- Axis does a better job than most with ONVIF compliance, so their API may not be necessary). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike you, I used all of the current open projects before deciding that we were going to make our own. They generally use an absurd amount of resources because most of them are just using Electron (or similar) to launch a web-browser with custom code into an executable file. This makes it so that they can run in a desktop environment, but nowhere else. This is also why they struggle so much on framerates. A web-browser is a quick way to launch this sort of app, but not a tremendously efficient one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe took a different route. Our lead developer programmed the single-use surveillance system used by Norad for monitoring the US nuclear silos. He decided to use C++ and QT code so that we could write a singular codebase and then be able to compile and effectively run on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and Linux ARM based embedded devices. Embedded QT is also stripped down enough to run in the resource starved environment that is most NVRs at 4K 30 FPS. Ambrella and Hisilicon do a fantastic job at H.264/5 hardware encoding, but don't leave a lot of resources on the table for analytics or decoding (playing video). Our iOS version should launch soon (we solved a major technical hurdle this week) and is wrapped in React. Android will be coming, but has the same QT to React hurdle for displaying video for us to solve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe just hired a machine learning specialist this week to begin work on Milestone 2, which is cloud storage, analysis via TensorFlow and OpenCV, and evidence / incidence reporting. We're currently evaluating Intel Movidius chips / sticks as part of the stack. We're currently looking for a Director of Cloud Engineering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe also have just received toolchains from 2 major manufacturers for putting our application onto their POE NVRs. Our goal for the NVRs is to take the Cirrus App and turn in into an OS and make a camera-manufacturer-neutral NVR (currently ONVIF cross-manufacturer compatibility only works when the camera is on the network).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe currently a retailer, so we will continue to sell products, but we will be adding some diversity to our company when Cirrus is totally done. Our business model is anything that can be run on the client's recorder or camera is free; anything that takes up server resources or distributed computing would eventually have a cost.   \n\n\nWe plan on open sourcing the vast majority of this project, eventually. We, originally, wanted to go that route 100%, but have been forced not to do so because of several factors:\n\n(1) the NVR functionality can't be open sourced completely, as it needs to include a bunch of closed source code, such as H.264 / H.265 encoding/decoding and manufacturer API support, as we want to have the software play nice with devices without our code.\n\n(2) the camera firmware is where we see the most ability to create open source code. Our idea is to give it away to any manufacturer who wants to use it. \n\n(3) open source has a lot of advantages, but there's some dangers as well. The open source ONVIF Device Manager discovery tool scandal showed what can go wrong with open sourcing surveillance software (the tool had malicious code in it that no one caught for a long time)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", 1, "t3_arzeal"], "egqu6lh": ["I think it's a great idea, but it's going to require way too much processing power.

Or maybe not since you are on this subreddit. \n\nI had a few problems with my old dishwasher:\n\n1. I could never tell when the rinsing fluid was low or out. \n\n2. I have hard water so I need a built in water softener (until I get around to getting a whole home one).\n\n3. Modern dishwashers are all pretty silent. Like 42dB silent, which is the noise level of a library. since I never know when the dishwasher is running; even when I'm right in front of it, I don't know when it's done because all applicance makers have decided to use the exact same beep. Unloading the dishwasher is my wife's job so she likes to claim she didn't know it was run or that it's done. \n\nThe Bosch SHEM78WH5N solved all of those problems and more. \n\nIt tells you when rinse fluid is low and can order more from Amazon (although I use subscribe and save so I won't be using this),  it has a water softener and monitors the amount of salt you have and can order more, connects to IFTTT for notifications, it keep track of how many dishwashing tabs you have left and can order more or notify you. \n\nSetup was easy. The app is decent, although with voice control through Google home/assistant via IFTTT I don't think I will be using it much. The most surprising thing to me was how privacy and security focused it was (besides it recommending WPS which is insecure). User tracking is off by default. The app has a setting to disconnect the dishwasher from their servers and only have it accessible on the LAN. It also has an API (which I think can be local) and a free developer program. \n\nOh, and it's a great dishwasher. Like the best consumer dishwasher you can get. \n\nNow for the downsides.\n\nIt doesn't hold more than 1 cleaning tablet. Not a big deal if you can remember to put one in when you are unloading it. It's just a habit you and your family have to get into. \n\nThe API is free to use but not opensource. \n\nNo direct google home/assistant support. You will need IFTTT or Home assistant. Alexa is supported. \n\nThe biggest one is the price. It's like $1,300 installed and delivered. But I accidentally found a loophole in BestBuys pricing. BestBuy lists the lower model Bosch 800s as being app controlled which is wrong. I had the other one sent and installed but couldn't find how to connect to it because it didn't exist. Called BestBuy to confirm and they refunded the first model and with a little bit of a sob story and frustration (I never was rude to the rep) they offered me the dishwasher I have now for $900.

I'd recommend having it just dispense small amounts through the day and night, that way kitty never has long periods of \"OMG I'M STARVING!!!!\" and the destruction that results from that.

Go with an automation system with built-in security. Of all the options, this is the simplest. However, it will also be either the most expensive (high monthly cost), or the least reliable (uses systems not truly meant for security). I can't speak for all of them, but the ones that I've look into are very, *very* expensive. Vivint, for instance, is $75/month. \"Nothing is too large a price to pay for peace of mind,\" my eye. This option is likely going to be a painfully limiting one, too; automation will be harder, apps more difficult to use, and a fairly small number of technologies it will work with - Vivint does Z-Wave, but won't talk with Hue, for instance.\n\n2. Set up smart devices to monitor doors, windows, fire, whatever. Then have whatever system you set up manipulate a single relay connected to a cheap, dumb, off-the-shelf, $10/mo monitored alarm service. The smart house portion does its smart house thing, and when it detects a problem, the smart house half takes care of notifying you, leaving the security part to only do the phone-the-police bit. It's not going to be smart - if you have a fire alarm as part of your smart house, for instance, it'll hook up to the same alarm, but at least you'll have monitored service. This is likely the cheapest option, but it'll be a little tricky to set up, and won't be quite as reliable as other options.\n\n3. Use dual-purpose wired circuits. Run wired sensors for doors, windows, CO sensors, and fire alarms, etc. Get a monitored, fully-wired system, then hook the sensors up to both the wired system and your smart house system. You'll be able to monitor the house through the security system, and still use the sensors to run your smart house, too.\n\n4. Finally: Use two systems. If there isn't a lot of overlap (say, you only want smart sensors on the front and back doors), just get two sensors for those doors, one for the smart house, one for the security system. Get a cheap, reliable, off-the-shelf security system, and let it do its thing, separate from the smart house. This is the simplest option, and likely the cheapest option, as long as there isn't a lot of overlap.\n\nAs for sensors, cameras should be manually accessed. Even really good cameras get a lot of false alarms, and there's nothing that annoys your neighbors more than constantly blaring alarms. It only takes a few before they are desensitized to them. Instead, get cameras you can access remotely, but have your security system ping you to check them. Use the security sensors - doors and windows, glass break, motion, etc. - to set off an alarm, not the cameras. Unless you're willing to go fully DIY and get your hands dirty, the cameras should be their own separate thing, not really connected to anything else.\n\nDoor and window sensors are the most important, and generally cheapest, then fire/smoke/CO detection, then glass break and motion sensors, then water leak and other specialty sensors.", 1, "t3_bldhxf"], "emnttjd": ["i mentioned the 21p pushing alarm signals to a phone. if you wanted to then use a relay expansion module to do local home automation tasks in response to the alarms it wouldn't matter if you had a 21 or a 20. but i think the native phone notification for the 21 is much stronger. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy ademco panel info is likely out of date, haven't worked with them in a number of years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe 20 panel is certainly capable of driving home automation through relay expansion, just not sure how fancy the phone notification options would be. vista20 is way cheaper, too.", 1, "t1_emnp5bo"], "eo4kzc6": ["Looks really great, man.

We already have a separate camera system installed around the property.\n\nThis is where it gets iffy for me, and where inexperience becomes a problem.\n\nI'm not sure whether to go for a pre-built kit, or if I should go for a DIY solution.\n\nFor pre built kits, I'm pretty much down to two very similar systems\n[One](Yale Sync Smart Home Alarm (Works with Amazon Alexa) https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FR78X16/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_MU-kCb5XC2E6R)\nAnd [two](Yale Smart Home Alarm Kit https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01I549JFO/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_JV-kCb3ZJEZ9E)\n\n\nFor a DIY solution, I was looking at a HomeAssistant (or alternative) method on a raspberry pie, zwave adapter and sensors. \n\nMy issue with this solution is that I'm not sure what sensors to go for. I'm a compsci guy so getting down and technical isn't an issue. Also, Im struggling to find an app which will allow for realtime notifications. (IE if a door is opened, it pings my phone saying so)\n\nCurrently, there is very few \"smart appliances\" in the house. But I'm heading in that direction for this project.\n\nAnd that's where I'm at. I'm wondering what people would do in this situation and which would be best. I'll put some points below to summarize what it ought to be/have:\n\n- smart home alarm system\n\n- door sensors, window/glass break sensors, motion sensors, PIR camera (maybe)\n\n- certain sensors should be set to trip the alarm immediately, whilst others should have an entrance/exit delay. (Though I gather this is a fairly normal feature to have)\n\n- lightswitches/plugs which can be turned on/off remotely/independently, and also can be set to turn on should an alarm be triggered.\n\n- a wireless keypad/maybe rfid fobs which can be used to arm/disarm/part-arm the system. (So it needs to work both locally without an app, as well as with an app for control)\n\n- realtime notifications to Android devices on events like motion triggers, glass break, and arm/disarms (We're solely Android here)\n\n- the ability to isolate sensors/exclude a sensor from the alarm forest. IE removing a sensor from the system temporarily so that it does not trigger an alarm. \n\n- the system does NOT need to be monitored by a company - we'll handle that. Just needs to be accessible remotely (different user accounts as well, so we know who is doing what)\n\n\nI realize this is a long one, and any suggestions are welcome. I'm new to the home security field, so if ive missed anything please do say and I'll add more info where necessary. Also, written on mobile so I apologize in advance for any formatting issues. I'm going to try to fix them now! \n\nThanks everyone :)\n", "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/abn2pb/smart_home_alarm_system_kit_vs_diy/", 1, 27, "homeautomation", "security", {"ed1ln3l": ["Check out www.konnected.io.\nNot sure if it works in the UK, but it checks most of the boxes you're asking for.

Our preferred features are:\n\n-video doorbell and security cameras\n\n-smart lighting which we can change for the moment (such as \"movie mode\" for the living room, different settings for the bedroom, and ideally a programmable system where we could say, set up \"morning mode\" where the lights come up gradually either on schedule or with the push of a button). Color changing bulb options for this are a plus but not a \"need.\" Indoor and outdoor lighting settings a must.\n\n-smart thermostat (would be great if it could include our heated floors in kitchen and bath. we have a boiler with 3 zones, so if there is a \"mother/queen\" unit and some drones that would be cool)\n\n-smart garage door opener/closer\n\n-Keyless entry at the front door (key sharing is a bonus)\n\n-Operation of blinds in certain rooms (again, like the living room for movie time, bedroom for night/morning)\n\n-other fun smart features, like connecting our sprinklers to our weather station, telling the system to start the coffee, etc. \n\nWe know that most or all of these things already exist, but would like to choose one system (IE Google vs Amazon vs Apple vs Ring vs Whatever) that can operate them all, ideally both on a tablet (or similar) to stay at home and our phones for some things. We don't want to have 5 different remotes or apps. Does Google Home operate most of those things?\n\nWe did have a Kevo smart lock at our last house, but there were a lot of limitations with that since it only worked with certain phones (even though it was bluetooth?) and you otherwise needed the key fob.\n\nI am open to suggestions or even being told we need to wait, but at the least we would like to get the doorbell and cameras set up pretty shortly.\n\nOur main concern is one cohesive, overall system tat we can operate without too much hassle, like in the movies.

{"bqh6td": ["Home Automation - what do your wives and girlfriends think?\nMy smart home setup caused the biggest fight I\u2019ve had with my wife in almost 20 years of marriage this morning.\n\nSure, she\u2019d been bickering here and there when a light didn\u2019t go on immediately etc but overall, it was more on the anecdotal side of things. \n\nToday, my daughter asked me at the breakfast table why her blinds make her room dark during the day. I said they\u2019re set to lower automatically when the sun directly shines into her room, which quickly raises the temp in the room to over 85 degrees F. \n\nMy wife then joined in and said she hates it when hers do that and she hates everything else I\u2019ve put in our (smart) home. At that point, I freaked, left the table and took down everything. I mean everything - all the lights, the garage door opener, the door locks, the thermostats, everything. I cancelled all music services, removed all HomePods, the Roomba, the family calendar - and I was pretty shocked to find out how little time tearing it all down took compared to putting it all up and making it work. \n\nI had hoped she\u2019d tell me that some of it was actually useful once she\u2019s realized that she now needs to take a key with her on her dog walks, has to turn on the hallway lights manually and needs to use an old AC remote to get her room cooled down. Nope. The only thing she\u2019s mentioned so far is that it\u2019ll now suck to give our dog sitter access to the house. \n\nI\u2019m not sure whether she\u2019s too proud to admit that things actually worked pretty well and made our lives considerably easier and more organized, or whether she really thinks things are better this way. In any case, I guess we\u2019ll be living in 1985 again now. \n\nThe only thing I noticed however is that the kids have no clue how to work thing without voice control.

Vacuuming is one of our least favorite chores and one of our dogs is terrified of the big upright, consequently we dragged the time between vacuuming out and got the upright out once a week which is not ideal with 3 dogs. Roberta changed everything! She is super quiet and the dogs don't mind her at all.  She runs every day and the house has never looked cleaner.   \n\n\nThe downside to Roberta is, she is a \"dumb\" robot, you can only have on scheduled run per day, so we are considering placing her upstairs and getting another robot for the downstairs.    \nUltimately I would like a smart robot that can clean specific zones on schedules and via voice. So I would like to be able to say \"Alexa, clean the kitchen\" and the robot does just that and  be able to schedule the vacuum so it cleans the bathroom every morning after getting ready etc. Mopping would be a nice additional feature but the ones that do are apparently not super good at it anyway. \n\nApparently none of them are quiet there yet, but it looks like they are just a software update or two away from these features.   \n\n\nAfter hours of research the following robots seem to be the most promising: Roborock S5,  Deebot 900 and Neato D7. \n\n  \nI have been doing some price matching and it seems I can get the $356 from Newegg with a Euro plug but would not have any warranty whatsoever or for $569 from Amazon with 1 year warranty. Correct me if I'm wrong even if I bought the Roborock from Newegg with extended Visa warranty I would not be covered because there is no US warranty to extend?  \nThe Neato D7 is $589 on Amazon, it checks all the boxes and Alexa room cleaning seems to be the next logical software update for them.   \nThe Deebot  I can get for $279, it has all the features but then again it has a smaller battery, smaller receptacle, less power than the Roborock. \n\n  \nI tend to want to go for the Roborock  but the lack of any kind of warranty scares me, and if I buy it from Amazon I might as well go for the Deebot for $20 more.\n\n  \nAny input or advise would be greatly appreciated, as I just can't make up my mind.   \nHappy New Year!

The smart multifunctional gateway\n2. Door and window sensors\n3. Some smart lights. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGateway: First problem I have is that there are various versions and brands of it. Xiaomi, Mijia and Aqara. Which one is better, newer and compatible with what is a total confusion for me. There aren't model numbers on these that I can search things by so I need to understand which one should I go for. I am the kind of person who will pay a little more but get latest hardware and also most compatible. I want to have (if possible) just one application to control all things from and if not possible, Apple Homekit and Google Assistant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoor and window sensors: This SHOULD be straightforward because I think sensors from either the mijia brand or aqara brand should work with either gateways but if I am wrong, please let me know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmart lights: One function I prefer is local connectivity so I think zigbee is the way. As I understand, zigbee allows you to control devices even if your gateway itself has lost internet. As long as your phone and gateway are on the same wifi, you should be fine. Again, there is yeelight/xiaomi/aqara bulbs so not sure which one is compatible with what. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice on either of the 3 things would be great if someone can help. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDhaval ", "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/ap52qm/newbie_to_home_automation/", 1, 3, "homeautomation", "trust", {"egewy06": ["&gt;Just read through your getting started guide and it seems this place is for a very advanced and busy users.\n\nI would rewrite the guide to be even more user-friendly, but I'm actually involved in writing an e-book for beginners. When I have completed that project, I will revisit the post, though that will probably be too late for your needs ;-)\n\n&gt;Once this is setup, I can start on raspberry pi and these advanced automation controllers.\n\n\nTo be honest, I'm not real familiar with Pi setups. I have an RPi, but only to add features to my Hubitat \"hub\". Compared to Hubitat or Wink, a RPi running Home Assistant isn't actually a cheap solution. My setup, with a case and heatsink-fan, was more expensive than my Hubitat (and my SmartThings). However, that's also not including a Zigbee and/or Z-Wave radio. All combined, an RPi setup will probably be $150 to $200. It also took several hours to get it up and running, though I was not installing automation software. If you have Linux experience, it would presumably be a lot smoother.\n\n&gt;I really want someone to tell me pros and cons of this new aqara gateway used in the UK.\n\nI trust you saw my \"mega review\" concerning Hubitat, and presume you've decided against it. If not... In short, the only major issue with it is that there's no app for remote access (it's supposed to be released in April, but will probably be rudimentary, but no feature set has been published). If that's not an issue, I have no reservations in recommending it as a cheaper alternative to an RPi (though more expensive than SmartThings; see below). Nonetheless, with that presumption in mind....\n\nI've never used the Aqara hub or read up on it. I doubt it's a serious contender, but I would bet that the software side of it slapped together garbage. If you are short on money to be able to get both an RPi and devices to actually automate (and not interested in or can afford the Hubitat), then I'd recommend a SmartThings as a good place to learn, with some caveats. First, I'd suggest planning on transitioning to something else. Aside from being cloud-based, it's a capable device, but I just do not trust Samsung's leadership to not screw it up (more than they already have). Second, don't even bother with the built-in automation methods (such as the Smart Light App, or \"routines\"). Start with using WebCoRe. It will probably be more than enough to handle anything you might want to do, but if not, then learn how to write your own apps.\n\n&gt;I am also trying to understand why these gateways require their server set to China and not any other region.\n\nShort answer is that Xiaomi isn't concentrating on the European and American markets. Although they do have US and European plug options for appliances, even their cellphones lack the US frequencies. That would by another concern with the Aqara. I know it does not support Z-Wave, which does have a different frequency in Europe, but not sure on Zigbee. I presume not, or else their sensors wouldn't work at all outside China.\n\nMy biggest concern for you would be starting out learning a system that simply won't apply. At least get as close to your ideal setup at the beginning as you can afford. Again, I don't know for sure, but getting the Aqara might end up being  like buying a bicycle to learn how to drive a stick-shift.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything, or the same thing again if I didn't answer your question.", 1, "t1_egeudpo"], "egeudpo": ["Hi /u/redroguetech \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust read through your getting started guide and it seems this place is for a very advanced and busy users. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can probably do a raspberry pi setup but I want to get started with simplest of stuff, ofcourse money is important but this is one area i want to get into. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I want to to start first with simple thing.

But it works from warm being 0 to 4000k which is like 1/3 way to cool. It's probably because the bulb doesn't support more than 4000k and that's fine but the UI should adjust accordingly. \n3. Aquara door sensor was tricky to set up. I couldn't tell u how I did it, just kept pressing the reset button and suddenly it appeared after like 14th try. Work beautifully tho. Automation is limited to a notification for now and notification is around 10 to 15 seconds late but it works well. \n4. Nest: Now this is a nightmare. I have a Nest thermostat and I followed the complicated process to add it and though it appears to have integrated well, its kinda read only right now.

Not sure with IKEA, but when Hue bulbs (which also use ZLL) are connected as ZHA, they aren't easy to switch from ZHA back to ZLL. But Hue bulbs can't easily be factor reset - IKEA you just turn it on and off six times.\n\nXiaomi does off a multipurpose sensor, but without as much stuff. The \"vibration\" sensor has tilt, impact, and acceleration. I have a couple of them to automate the washer and dryer, but haven't used them except for a basic \"proof of concept\" test. The humidity sensor has temp and pressure. I have three of them. I've not spent a lot of time with calibration, but they seem wildly inaccurate with humidity (not tracked temp or pressure).

Just toss them under a sink, and add a notification alert. Then on to motion sensors..... I've got two installed in my son's room, and they seem to do okay, but he hasn't filled out the beta test report forms.\n\nAlso check out Gledopto bulbs. They are ZLL and full color. They come in two different wattages. I got a low-wattage on and put it in my son's room. He reported that it would would flicker/blink a few times an hour, and the color brightness is a bit disappointing (but white brightness was as expected). I ordered the higher wattage one, and found it too large to fit in any of the light fixtures, so swapped his out (as a lamp where size not an issue).

I spent a lot of time reading reviews about the array of products, and have hit analysis paralysis. Too much outdated information, lots of reviews ignoring systemic issues with locks that appear frequently in consumer reviews.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblems that I need a smart lock to solve in order of priority:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife loses her keys in her purse about 80% of the time and it takes on average about 30-45 seconds for her to dig them out and open up the door. Most of the time it's literally faster for me to set down whatever or whoever I'm carrying and get my keys out. This has been a problem with her forever, and a change in behaviors is unlikely at this point. Smart lock would ideally sense her phone nearby and unlock the door without any voice command needed. I consider this the primary reason to get the lock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYoung kids that need to open the door. Very familiar with using a pin to unlock devices, but still struggling to use a key properly because of reasons. My keys will often get left in the door lock when they open the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLocking the door on a schedule. I'd prefer the door to automatically lock and unlock at certain times of the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional considerations:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot willing to pay a monthly fee, or reoccurring fees like ekeys for anything, because f\\*\\*\\* that. I know ekeys are free for now, but I refuse to be someones monthly revenue stream for a damn lock. I'd rather stick with a mechanical lock in that case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExtra hub needed is okay. I have a hue hub, but I understand it's limitations. If a different hub such as Z-wave or whatever is required, that's okay. If required I would prefer a lock that is compatible with 3rd party hub such SmartThings. Not interested in a Schlage brand hub, for example. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe use the Apple ecosystem, but I'm not a user of voice commands. I personally don't like doing it. I don't use, nor will I ever have a system like Alexa or Google Home, so these features are irrelevant. We do not have an Apple TV, and if required as a hub, probably wouldn't get used much for anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would have liked a keyless door, but my new door is coming pre-bored from the factory for 2 holes, so I need a lock that is designed for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, there was one lock I tested in the store, I don't remember which one it was.

I wish there was a nice cheap solution for indoor blinds, but there seems to be none, so I'm skipping that - I have my blinds open most of the time anyways, since indoor blinds kinda suck. :/\n\nThe issue I'm torn about the most are lights. I know I could just put some smart lighbulbs there and be done with it, but what to do with the switches on the walls?\n\nIf I understand it correctly (and please, correct me if I'm wrong), I need to keep all switches on the wall in the \"On\" position all the time, and just use my phone/some external switch to turn the lights on/off? Given that I have 11 separate light circuits planned (in a kinda small flat - hall, 1 bedroom, walking closet, living room, kitchen and a bathroom w/ toilet), it seems like a bitch work to turn these lights on/off from phone instead of just hitting the switches at the walls, if they are going to be reasonably placed?\n\nI like the features like being able to change the temperature/color of the light bulb (or just simply dim it), but I'm not really sure if it's worthwhile? Also, while I could get used to control it through separate means and not touch the switches on the walls (which are kinda needed, e.g., if you want to change the lightbulb when it dies?), what about my guests? They will be used to hitting the switches, and will turn off my lights, and screw up the smart aspect of it anyways?\n\nI'll be glad for any opinions, including your experience with guests and your smart lights.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/ahchqd/lights_yay_or_nay/", 1, 13, "homeautomation", "trust", {"eedacag": ["Didn't even realize you can use smart switches with \"dumb\" lights.

I thought hopefully a in-depth break down of my experience with them may help other people. The Petwant was my first smart pet feeder and I\u2019ve owned the same one for more than 2.5 years and everything still works fine since the day I bought it. So I can say with confidence my overall experience with it as being, in general, a reliable feeder considering it has lasted without hardware failure or motor burnout this long albeit it would only really work in a single pet cat or small dog household. \n\nI only tested the Petnet and Dogness for a few days so far, so my reviews are based on my experience with them thus far and may update my review of the Dogness feeder once I\u2019ve had it longer. Unfortunately, the Petnet showed so much wifi network and app failure early on after testing for a few days I decided to just return it and will not be able to give a long-term use review unless I somehow get one for free later down the road to review. \n\nOut of all the feeders, I will keep on using the Dogness Smart Pet Feeder with my large dog who eats large kibble and give away my Petwant feeder to a friend who only has a cat.\n\n**Control Variables:** I tested the pet feeder using Wellness Core Large Breed Dog food (worst - pyramid shape and large size kibble) and Victor Nutra Pro Dog food (best - round shape and small-sized kibble). The network router I was using is a Google Wifi mesh router. I was running all my pet feeder android ver. apps on a Google Pixel 1 phone. \n\n# Dogness: [https://www.amazon.com/DOGNESS-Automatic-Smart-Camera-Feeder/dp/B07JVSGYG4/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049600&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dogness+automatic](https://www.amazon.com/DOGNESS-Automatic-Smart-Camera-Feeder/dp/B07JVSGYG4/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049600&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dogness+automatic)\n\n**Capacity:** Claims 6 liters or 6.5 lbs of food  / I measured 20 cups\n\n**Time:** Military\n\n**Meal Units:** Metric gram portions.\n\n**Jam Occurrence:** Never Jammed Yet\n\nEasy to get to connect to WiFi. Always worked on the first try to bind feeder to the app. App registers pet feeder as offline during app use unless you constantly restart and reopen the app again to reconnect wifi to the feeder. However, after newly opening the app, the app always is able to quickly find and connect to the pet feeder and camera on the pet feeder.\n\n**Camera/Video Quality:** Claims unknown specified HD camera. Claims wide angle 165-degrees. Offers adequate camera video quality. Even though Dogness claims a large 165-degree wide angle lens, in fact, is noticeably not as wide angle as the Petwant camera in real life testing. Also even though Dogness claims it is fitted with a HD camera the quality of the images shows otherwise. It feels more like an SD camera, or the worst quality HD camera I\u2019ve ever tested. Has significantly smaller aperture sensor size than the Petwant so needs a larger amount of sunlight to register the same amount of exposure on the camera feedback. Useable but not good iso performance and exposure spectrum, and aren\u2019t able to capture as much detail in images as the Petwant during standard sunlight mode. Granted I\u2019m really picky about image quality but I think the average non-camera centric person will find it acceptable.\n\nHowever, it has a great night vision function. For some reason when in night vision mode, it has improved picture quality, color depth, and clarity. Does an okay job of switching from daylight mode to night mode on its own but could be greatly improved. Its threshold for darkness is not very high, so even though there is enough sunlight to see adequately using the camera, the software will decide for you to jump the gun and switch to night mode which can be frustrating. I wish you could manually choose which mode to use instead of relying on the ai to decide on its own when to turn it on appropriately, or if there was an option to set the nightmode darkness sensitivity so you could change the threshold on how sensitive the nightmode activation is.\n\n**Microphone/ Audio Sound Quality:** Works great with little to no background static noise, separate talk and listen function like a walkie talkie. Would like to see improvement with a two-way audio and mic function instead so you can need only one button to talk and listen not two separate buttons. Speaker and audio are the clearest on this feeder, has the highest clarity in audio and speaker feedback.\n\n**Google Assistant/Alexa Compatible:** None. Would love to see this feature added in the future.\n\n**In case of power failure**: Is very reliable and will continue to dispense food even if the power goes out using batteries (confirmed) and even if it cannot connect to the WiFi network for many days probably even capable for weeks (confirmed via testing). It stores the last known feeding instructions on to the actual physical feeder hardware itself instead of an outside cloud network which is optimal so it will continue feeding your pet.\n\n**Portion Size:** Capable of dispensing 1/16 - roughly 3.5 cups each meal up to 6 pre-schedule meals.\n\n**Bowl:** Can hold 3 cups of food. Has a stainless steel bowl removable liner. Tilted angled shape perfect for making kibble fall and dispense equally near the bottom of the bowl instead of piling up at the location of the dispensing hole like other feeders preventing jams and food backing up into the food dispensing chute. Smartest and most practical feeder design tested.\n\n**Food level Sensor:** No. The company claims to be working on implementing it on a newer app version in the future. But so far doesn\u2019t have it, but does tell you when there is no more food in the container to dispense.\n\n**Excess food Sensor:** Fantastic.\n\n**Seal on Food Container:** Fantastic. Rubber gasket on container\u2019s seal provides the best airtight seal on the food container out of all the pet feeders. Also has a slot to hold a packet of desiccant to prevent moisture contamination. Seems to keeps dry food the freshest from spoilage, staleness and prevents unwanted pests.\n\nEvent management log: The most reliable at accurately logging dispensed food and diagnosing all specific issues and errors with the machine. \n\n**Multi-Pet use:** Yes. It can be used to bind multiple dogness feeders and other dogness smart products to ONE app account. You can use multiple different phones to log into the same account to control the same feeder as long as they are not attempting to log in at the same time. \n\n**Pros:**\n\nCan bind multiple Dogness smart products and control them all from the same account\n\nNightvision function\n\nBest Integrated speaker and mic\n\nLargest food capacity\n\nWorks with big and odd shaped kibble\n\nBest seal on the food container\n\nNever jams cause of smart angled bowl and food chute design\n\nEasy Install and Setup\n\nStainless steel bowl\n\nReliable event management\n\nReliable error diagnosis\n\nReliable wifi network connection\n\nCustomer service phone number is located in USA and is very responsive\n\n**Cons:** \n\nIntegrated video camera quality, aperture and lens wideness could be better\n\nOverly sensitive nightmode\n\nNot Google Assistant/Alexa compatible\n\nNo food level sensor yet\n\nNo option to switch to standard time\n\nNo option to switch to imperical cup food measuring\n\nDogness products are new to the market and just started selling their products recently, app has a lot of room to improve upon to be more functional - expect growing pains.\n\nNo custom pet nutrition and serving recommendations on app\n\n# 2nd Gen Petnet : [https://www.amazon.com/Petnet-SF20A-W-SmartFeeder-Automatic-Feeder/dp/B07C3V32VR/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049577&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=petnet+smartfeeder+2.0](https://www.amazon.com/Petnet-SF20A-W-SmartFeeder-Automatic-Feeder/dp/B07C3V32VR/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049577&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=petnet+smartfeeder+2.0)\n\n**Capacity:** Claims 5-7 lbs of food / I Measured: 17 cups\n\n**Time:** Standard\n\n**Meals Units:** Imperical system cup portions.\n\n**Jam Occurrence:** Ocassionally will jam once every 10 meals if used with odd shaped or large kibble. It doesn\u2019t jam if you are using small round kibble.\n\n**Wifi Connectivity Reliability:** I had so many wifi issues, and had to try a few times to bind the feeder to wifi with random luck. Unable to diagnose issues just had to hope it worked each time. Has consistent issues with dropping network connection over time even within the same day sometimes. May would work better with a non-mesh router. It\u2019s also dumb that the barcode you need access to in order to bind the Petnet to your wifi is located on the bottom of the base of the feeder, so you have to flip it upside down every time you want to reconnect it. \n\n**Camera/Video Quality:** None included compared to other feeders on the market which are cheaper and have integrated cameras. Claims that it is Nest camera compatible however if you desire a video camera functionality on your Petnet. I don\u2019t have a nest camera so I didn\u2019t get to test this functionality to see how it performed in real-life testing.\n\n**Google Assistant/Alexa Compatible:** It claims it\u2019s compatible but it\u2019s terrible. Would not recommend. Didn't test with Alexa since I only use Google products in my home. But if it's anything like the compatibility to Google it's terrible. May as well not exist. Most of the time doesn't register that Petnet is even linked to your Google assistant. Can never find your Petnet to manually link it to your Google assistant either.\n\n**In case of power failure**: Petnet claims 7 hours-2 days of battery life without wifi or power which means you are SOL in case it happens while you are on vacation. It stores the last known feeding instructions onto an outside third party server cloud network which has a history of going down and when it goes down Petnet feeders will fail to work and dispense food. This could be improved if they stored the data onto the actual feeders themselves like other smart feeders.\n\n**Portion size:** Capable of dispensing 1/16 - 1 1/2 cups each meal. Can preschedule up to 5 meals in a day. In the past the app was able to schedule an unlimited number of meals, this is not the case as of now but hopefully this changes in the future.\n\n**Bowl:** Claims to hold 2.5 cups of dry food. Has a dishwasher safe metal bowl removable liner. The flat shape of the bowl prevents kibble from dispensing equally to the bottom of the bowl. Relies on the motor of the feeder to shoot out food farther down the bowl. Inevitably kibble piles up at the location of the dispensing hole like other feeders causing it to more often has food backing up into the food dispensing chute but it's not as often or as bad as the Petwant feeder. \n\nPro: compared to the Petwant it has a more angled chute so it is able to have better even kibble distribution to the bowl but the angled design is not as angled as the Dogness which relies on a smart bowl shape and gravity feed design instead of the motor power to push down the kibble a farther distance into the bowl.\n\n**Food Level Sensor:** Best food level sensor, the app does a good job of estimating how much food is left in the container.\n\n**Excess Food Sensor:** Meh. It\u2019s super inconsistent. I don\u2019t trust it\u2019s notifications and diagnosis of issues at all. If it gets the issue correct it was more luck than good programming.\n\n**Seal on Food Container:** Good. No rubber gasket on container\u2019s seal but seems to provide an adequate seal on the food container based on a tension locking system. Doesn\u2019t have a slot to hold a packet of desiccant to prevent moisture contamination. Seems to keeps dry food the adequately fresh from going stale but can be improved with the implementation of an airtight rubber gasket. \n\n**Accuracy of Event Management Log:** Usable but needs improvement and is not reliable. 50% of the time will work, 50% of the time it will sometimes not log events correctly and have false positive notifications (dispense excess food, jam, abnormal machine, network error, no food, etc.), sometimes will not even log an event at all even though it had dispensed food, or will log it had dispensed food but didn\u2019t.\n\n**Multi-Pet Use:** No. It can only be used to bind ONE feeder to ONE app account. App only allows you to control one feeder at a time. But you can use multiple different phones to log into the same account to control the same feeder as long as they are not attempting to log in at the same time. If you have multiple pets currently the only way to manage multiple feeders from a single smartphone/tablet is by creating a second account with a different email and logging in with it. You could also use a second smartphone/tablet to control the second SmartFeeder. Petnet claims to have a version of the app in the works that they will call \"Multi-pet\" so you don\u2019t have to log in and out to control multiple feeders.\n\n**Pros:**\n\nGood food capacity\n\nGood seal on food container\n\nFood portions are in Cups\n\nUses standard time\n\nAttractive app design\n\nApp has custom pet nutrition and serving recommendations for lots of different pet food\n\nIntegrated smartdelivery function to rebuy dog food when food is low\n\nBest food level sensor\n\nGoogle Assistant/Alexa/Nest compatible\n\nStainless steel bowl\n\nCustomer service phone number is located in USA and is responsive\n\n**Cons:** \n\nCannot bind multiple feeders and control them all from the same account (best for single pet home)\n\nNo Integrated video camera\n\nNo Integrated speaker and mic\n\nJams occasionally cause of a flat bowl causing food to pile up near the food chute\n\nThere is a gap of space between the bowl and food chute in gen 2 that kibble dust annoyingly collects in\n\nGoogle Assistant compatibility is terrible\n\nUnreliable event management\n\nUnreliable error diagnosis\n\nMost unreliable wifi network connection - not reliable with mesh router systems\n\n# Petwant/Jempet/Wopet (pf-103): [https://www.amazon.com/Petwant-SmartFeeder-Automatic-Dispenser-Controlled/dp/B01GFTZPDQ/ref=sr\\_1\\_6?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049545&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=petwant+automatic+pet+feeder](https://www.amazon.com/Petwant-SmartFeeder-Automatic-Dispenser-Controlled/dp/B01GFTZPDQ/ref=sr_1_6?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049545&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=petwant+automatic+pet+feeder)\n\n**Capacity:** Claims 4.3 liters / I measured 14 cups\n\n**Time:** Military\n\n**Meal Units:**: Metric gram portions\n\n**Jam Occurance:** Best with cat food and very small breed dog kibble the size of a pea, and round shaped kibble. When tested with small kibble it rarely ever (maybe at most every 6 months) had issues jamming and was very reliable. Jams all the time with anything bigger than small pea sized kibble. Will jam once every 4 meals if used with a medium to large kibble size, or non-round shaped kibble. If you want to make it work with big kibble I heard you could alter the feeder yourself.\n\n**Wifi Connectivity Reliability:** It never had problems connecting to WiFi as long as you have a compatible router. Rarely (maybe once every 6 months) drops network connection and has to be manually hard restarted and reconnected most likely this reliability depends on your network router compatibility. \n\n**In case of power failure**: Is very reliable and will continue to dispense food even if the power goes out using batteries (confirmed) and even if it cannot connect to the WiFi network for many days probably even capable for weeks (confirmed via testing). I haven\u2019t changed the initial D batteries since I got it 2.5 years ago. It stores the last known feeding instructions on to the actual physical feeder hardware itself instead of a outside cloud network which is optimal so it will continue feeding your pet.\n\n**Camera/Video Quality:** Claims 720p HD wide-angle 120 degrees. Best camera video quality. Even though it claims only 120-degree wide angle lens, it, in fact, has the best widest angle lens and gives you the clearest quality HD image even at only 720p. Significantly better camera lens than the Dogness feeder. Has the widest aperture sensor size, the best iso performance and best exposure, and is able to capture significantly more detail in images. This truly feels like a HD camera. No night vision function, best if paired with a home that has smart lights installed thus removing the need for night vision.\n\n**Microphone/ Audio Sound Quality:** Works adequately. Loud annoying background static noise whenever using listen function. Mic and audio are two separate talk and listen functions like a walkie talkie. Would like to see improvement with a two-way sound and mic function instead so you can need only one button to talk and listen not two seperate buttons. Speaker is adequately clear on this feeder but can be greatly improved, has a lot of background noise garbling. Clarity in audio and speaking feedback is usable but not ideal.\n\n**Google Assistant/Alexa compatible:** None\n\n**Portion size:** Capable of dispensing 1/16 - 1 cup each meal up to 4 pre-scheduled meals\n\n**Bowl:** Holds about 2 and \u00bd cups of dry food. Does not have a dishwasher safe stainless steel bowl removable liner, only a detachable plastic bowl. Can foresee some pets getting some acne sensitivity since the bowl is made from plastic. Plastic is porous and can grow and house bacteria in the surface micro pockets from holding pet food over time. The flat shape of the bowl prevents kibble from dispensing equally to the bottom of the bowl. The motor of the feeder is not strong enough to shoot out food farther down the bowl like the Petnet. If you choose to dispense more than a few portions, kibble regularly piles up at the location of the dispensing hole causing it to regularly have food backing up into the food dispensing chute jamming the chute. The worst design flaw out of all the feeders in this regard. You can get around this issue by taking the bowl off and putting the feeder on some stacked books to have the food free drop from the food chute down into the unconnected bowl.\n\n**Food Level Sensor:** None but will tell you if there is no more food via a push notification if there are no issues with jamming which can trigger a false positive no food level error.\n\n**Excess Food Sensor:** Does a good job most of the time but jamming issues can trigger a false positive dispensed excess food error.\n\n**Seal on Food Container:** Bad. No rubber gasket on container\u2019s seal and seems to not provide an adequate seal on the food container. Lid only clicks into place so it is the least pet-proof, insect, pest and spoilage proof. Food gets stale super fast because air easily circulates through the container. Doesn\u2019t have a slot to hold a packet of desiccant to prevent moisture contamination.\n\n**Accuracy of Event Management Log:** Usable but needs improvement and is not reliable. Will most of the time log events but it will regularly not log events correctly and have false positive notifications,(dispense excess food, jam, abnormal machine, network error, no food, etc.) sometimes will log it had dispensed food but didn\u2019t at all.\n\n**Multi-Pet Use:** No. It can only be used to bind ONE feeder to ONE app account. App only allows you to control one feeder at a time. But you can use multiple different phones to log into the same account to control the same feeder as long as they are not attempting to log in at the same time.

I have a petnet and it's worked well enough for me... they have had numerous server issues, which led me to just use it for all of my dogs meals so it's already scheduled and I'm not doing it on demand where I'm not certain the service will be online.  It's not very flexible, you can't cancel just one meal if you are planning on taking your dog hiking and will be feeding it on the road, you'll have to come home and dump the food back in the reservoir.

I would say a lot of people choose to do this, especially if they have more than one pet (some clients had a zoo of animals) making boarding very costly especially in NYC where boarding one pet alone costs minimum $70-$200+/night and some of these facilities they just stay in a kennel most of the day with no interaction except to be walked to go to the bathroom. The other situation I saw this often was with dogs who had behavioral issues, were elderly so didn't move around much, disabled or had medical issues (human or dog aggression, reactive, etc.) that made it dangerous, very unsafe and uncomfortable for the dog to be boarded outside of their home or be with other dogs in a unfamiliar environment with strangers. \n\nI would say it's very common at least in NYC to have someone drop in on dogs not just cats and leave them for short trips depending on the temperament of the individual dog. Optimally if we all had the money to hire around the clock care for all our dogs that would be great (I used to do this as well for wealthier families who needed pet hospice care), but I think it's unrealistic if we want to be able to re-home the enormous number of pets in the animal shelters.\n\nThanks for the longer term use review of the Petnet.

We just have a dog walker come walk him during call days and he otherwise can take care of himself like a cat. I can also check on him using the camera (which is mostly for me cause I miss and worry about him when I'm away). Most of our friends also work in medicine with long hours as nurses, doctors, scientists and med students so they also all have smart auto pet feeders.\nThe more time we can spend efficiently on the mundane chores the more time we can spend doing everything else (patients, kids, self care, playing with pets, chores, etc).\n\n1. If the pet feeder is reliable with very little failure rate you no longer need a pet sitter for short trips or long nights at work. You can just get someone to drop in occasionally as bookchaser mentioned.\n2. Pets will stop begging you to serve them food since they learn it only comes from the feeder.\n3.

How to get any of your Hue devices in Smartthings! (X-Post from r/smartthings)\nMy first attempt to explain this was [messy](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartThings/comments/b4ovz6/how_to_use_a_hue_dimmer_switch_with_smartthings/), and I've since realized that you don't actually need to use a *spare* bulb for this trick to work. You're much better off using a *borrowed* bulb instead!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a method to unlock the full smart-home potential of your Hue Dimmer switch. Use it to control Smartthings... *things*, or turn on /off Hue bulbs across multiple bridges. All without limiting/changing it's current functioning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Hue Dimmer switch, compared to the Smartthings button, has *many* more buttons to play around with (but you'll lose the temperature sensor... if you care). The Hue dimmer, with a third party app, allows for full customization of: *Press*, *Hold*, *Short Press, Long Press* for each of the 4 buttons. That's *16 triggers*, compared to the Smartthings button's 3. Not to mention; the Hue Dimmer can be set to \"First press, second press, third press; etc...\".\n\nThe Hue Dimmer is overall much more capable as a switch: and it looks nicer on a wall :) Plus they're around the same price; so, *why not?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What you'll need to unchain your Hue Dimmer:**\n\n* A Hue bulb borrowed from a friend; or\n* A bulb that's linked from one of your *other* Hue Bridges (you're an addict, get help)\n* A third party app that allows adjusting brightness to a specific # value to the dimmer switch (HueDynamic, All4Hue, Hue Essentials; just about *any* app)\n* Smartthings hub; linked to your Hue bridge\n* WebCoRE\n\n**Side Note:** You *could* just use a currently used bulb; but that would be annoying, and a waste. A *phantom bulb* would make everything much more practical without hindering any current configurations.\n\n# Stage 1: Creating a Phantom Bulb\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1:** Pair your *borrowed bulb* to your main hue bridge; or, in my case: I swapped two bulbs from two separate Bridges (I'm an addict), then paired the bulbs with the opposite Bridges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 2:** Rename the bulb to *\"Phantom bulb\"* (It doesn't *have* to be called this; but yes, it does).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 3:** Now pair the bulb(s) back to the original bridge(s) again. All the settings; the bulb's original name, assigned room, and dimmer buttons, will be restored to normal.\n\n# Stage 2: Program your Phantom Bulb into a Hue Third-Party App\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1:** Open your app and find where you're able to program your devices (I've been saying Hue Dimmer this whole time; but it just dawned on me that you can do this with *any* device)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 2:** Program your Dimmer switch (or whatever) to *any* set # brightness value for *any button* in whatever variation you choose. Keep these #'s in mind for later when you're using webCoRE.\n\nExample:\n\n* Press ON = **100%** brightness\n* Press DIM UP = **75%** brightness\n* Press DIM DOWN = **74%** brightness\n* Press OFF = **1%** brightness\n\nI only used 4 settings in this example for simplicity's sake, but as mentioned earlier; you could set up literally *any* of the app's dimmer customization potential (short press, hold, long press, first press, sixteenth press; whatever). And it doesn't matter if the brightness settings are close together (ie. 74%, 75%) . Any number value from 1 to 100 will do.\n\n# Stage 3: Set up webCoRE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1:** Okay; you're already ahead of me and know *exactly* how to use webCoRE. Cool. Good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 0:** Oh? You have *no idea* how to use webCoRE??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What the hell *is* webCoRE anyway??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure. I found out about it yesterday. As of writing this tutorial, I'm *totally* new to webCoRE. I'm not even the type of guy to write tutorials (how am I doing??).\n\nTo get your hands into webCoRE, Just follow [these steps](https://wiki.webcore.co/#Installing_webCoRE). It's time consuming; but, *really* easy to follow. And once you're in, you're in. It's easy to use from there :) Trust me, it's well worth the effort and time! These guys wrote an *amazing*program for Smartthings.\n\n# Stage 4: Use webCoRE to map the Phantom Bulb to whatever smart stuff you want\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo steps here. This is *your* playground now! But as an example, [Here's my webCoRE script](https://imgur.com/mQAI8V4) for my current Hue Dimmer's ON button function.\n\nMy bathroom came with the lights and fan plugged into the same circuit. So I fixed that:\n\n* Bathroom fan is plugged into Smartthings smart plug\n* Hue Dimmer's ON (hold) button is set to change the *Phantom Bulb* to 100%. This means that pressing \\*just\\* ON leaves the fan alone; only lights will turn on.\n* webCoRE is then mapped to turn on the Bathroom fan's Smart plug when the Phantom bulb is \"equal to\" 99% brightness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's an amazing feeling when you can *see* your home automation working! :)", "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/b534u2/crossplatform_hue_dimmer_switch_using_the/", 18, 9, "homeautomation", "trust", {"ejco25n": ["This is a very good point.
