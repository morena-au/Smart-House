            "Best Smart Home hub concerning security\nI'd  like to buy some smart home system to monitor my place when I'm out.  The functionality I need are motion sensors, flood sensors, door/window  open sensors and eventually cameras.\n\nI  wonder, however, about security of the system. I don't want a Amazon or  Google or 3rd party go gather (too much) data about me. My use case  excludes the need of constant listening (like Alexa) or even having a  mike. I just want to get a push notification on my phone when something  bad happens.\n\nI'm also concerned about  security of the gates and devices itself. How probable is that someone  will peek the data or take over the control of them? Which of the  systems are safest/best protected?\n\nIt would be great if the hub allow to connect devices from different manufacturers (based on ZigBee or Z-Wave).\n\nTaking this condition into consideration, can you recommend me some Hub, or give some advice regarding Smart Home Systems?",

            "Facebook Portal: Still Bad (Review)\nFor anyone wondering how the Portal is half a year out of the gate:  It's still bad.  Probably Abandonware.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Portal hardware isn't really any worse than the competition, I'm particularly happy with the speakers, and the face tracking is something I wish all video call apps would use.  However, that's pretty much where the good stuff ends.  The rest is all software problems, and Facebook seems to have no interest in improving on this front.\n\n  \nThe device doesn't make or receive calls from PCs, which is odd since even a phone can do this.  The voice controls can't do simple tasks like changing music volume or pause/play.  I'm not sure what Alexa can do as I think it dies in shame each time it sees it's on a Portal.  Call quality is very odd because there can be perfect picture quality with awful audio and vis-versa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankfully, the privacy button seems to work great because it's otherwise being randomly triggered all through the day if the mic is left on.  It's creepy having it ask what I want when I'm just trying to play trains with my son or eat breakfast.\n\n  \nThis is all extra lame since these problems are 99% software, and Facebook doesn't seem to be putting any effort into improving there.  I think they've seen the poor response to this thing and just walked away.  Which is what anyone thinking of buying it should do as well.",

Conceptually I'm iffy on it, I certainly don't have much trust for Fortune companies, but along the way, I've gone ahead and slowly added always-listening microphones to my and my husband's pockets, in our entryway security keypad (actually I didn't *know* I was putting that there - thanks Google/Nest - but I always assumed) and hell, my smoke detectors have mics for self-testing, in every room of the house.

My list is quite long:\n\n* Cloud based\n\n* No built in rules engine\n\n* No built in web page building, and what exists 3rd party is VERY limited compared to other systems, especially what I moved to.\n\n* The online community at the time was all \"well if a smartApp doesn't do what you want, just code it yourself in Groovy.\"\n\n* The SmartApp model is ridiculous--a crutch thrown at the system after the bone-headed choice to not have a built in rules engine. Result is you need multiple SmartApps to do what you want with any given device. I also once was advised by ST support to delete a device and re-add it to get it working. Well guess what, it was part of FOURTEEN different SmartApps. That took a damn long time, and then I had to add it back!\n\n* No real logging. You have to turn logging on BEFORE you want to see the log. So dumb. When I notice a problem I want to go see what caused it, not go turn on the log so I can see next time.\n\n* No Desktop client\n\n* ST forum users back in the day were all \"just code it yourself\" every time there was a question about how to do something no SmartApp allowed.\n\n* No integration with Mac OS, which allows tremendous superpowers.\n\n* Clunky 3rd party iTunes support\n\n* But #1: **reliability was truly terrible.** Unbelievably bad. I used ST during what was apparently the year of hell, where multiple developers for the platform all pulled their plugins in protest. (I hear this is better now but don't care, I'm done with ST.)

What are your plans for battery powered devices? Old-skool 433Mhz stuff is terribly unreliable, especially in large homes. Anything WiFi is going to have utter shit battery life. Z-wave is far superior for battery powered devices, with ZigBee and Thread being close behind. WiFi is terrible, it takes 1-3 seconds to connect, using a crapton of battery in the process. \n\nThe fastest I've seen a WiFi chip wake, transmit and return to sleep is 770ms. This is ridiculously slow compared to Z-wave's \\~10ms. Not only are WiFi chips awake a lot longer, they also use a lot more power during the wake. Go find me a WiFi motion sensor that can transmit hundreds of detections per day for over a year on a single battery. You won't because such a thing does not exist and literally can not exist because WiFi simply uses too much power.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; On the other hand, if you get a great WiFi setup, all your other regular WiFi devices (I.e. Phones, tablets, laptops, TV, speakers, smart watches, etc.) all can benefit from it as well. \n\nYou can do this without wasting 30+ Z-wave repeater nodes and have both good WiFi AND a solid Z-wave mesh. Then your phones and laptops work great AND you can get a bunch of power-sipping Z-wave battery powered devices and have them actually able to work properly since your mesh is super solid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd lastly, Z-wave stuff doesn't need some app on a phone to set up. There's tons of posts here about people with their random Chinese WiFi shit that needs an app to get connected to WiFi, and said app is no longer available. If you're lucky, you can open the device and find some UART connectors and flash a new firmware. Often they're glued shut and you're SOL and the device is garbage. \n\nEven beyond needing a app to set up most of these things, there's the issue of needing a 2.4Ghz 802.11b/g/n network for them. What are your plans for 10 years from now when your shiny new APs don't have these legacy standards? You gonna run a second ethernet over to each location and put the new ones next to the old ones? Skip out on upgrading because you need to keep that 802.11n that all your stupid WiFi devices connect to? Or are you gonna just put an old 2.4Ghz consumer-grade router somewhere and end up in the same spot of the dummies running the ISP routers or gaming ones. Or will you toss out a grand worth of WiFi crap and upgrade it all, while everyone with Z-wave stuff will be continuing on unconcerned with WiFi upgrades.",

                    "Not saying Z-Wave is bad; just want to point out a few counter-arguments as food for thought:\n\n1. Mesh is great if you have hard to reach places, however, every hop requires the radio to receive and retransmit the signal back out, which adds delay. If you have good WiFi setup properly blanket the coverage area, then the response time could be much faster than that of a repeated signal.\n2. A Zigbee/ZWave hub can essentially be thought of as a physical VLAN tagged port. Setting up devices in their own isolated VLAN and block out internet access is privacy steps that should be taken regardless of how things are implemented. Yes, a physical device does make it a bit easier than VLAN tagging.\n3. For my WiFi devices, most of them follow the open HomeKit standard from Apple, and does not require the vendor app on my phone. Even if the vendor goes the way of the dodos, the devices should still be able to function w/o regard for the vendor (I use should, because theoretically, the firmware could be broken AF and have a blocking call back to vendor servers before processing HomeKit API commands. Though, I highly doubt that's the case or Apple wouldn't allow them to use the HomeKit certified badge).\n4. Everything is done locally with HomeKit. Nothing have to leave my house or network for the command to be processed. I can do IFTTT if I want cloud-to-device functionality (i.e.: flash the lights if I get an email notifying me a Nigerian prince want to give me bazillion cash monies), but I can do all my automation w/o any cloud directly using HomeKit.\n\nThat all said, I do understand HomeKit devices tends to come at a premium. For example, my light switches are around $80 a pop whereas cheap WeMo are going for $40 or less, and other cheap junk from China can be had for &lt;$10. But, you get what you paid for. So, I can understand if people are on a tight budget, and aren't interested to go down a specific rabbit hole, ZWave or ZigBee is great. However, for people like me, who run servers at home, VLAN for fun, and doesn't want to deal with an extra network, WiFi devices running HomeKit is a great choice for simplicity on an already rock solid foundation.",

The only two things coming to mind are occupancy sensor (which I\u2019ll drill holes into ceiling to do POE) and smart blinds/curtains. Since I have no POE drops near Windows at this time, I have no solution for blinds but to go with batteries. I suppose with blinds, I can wait for them to respond a little bit slower and not worry about re-association time. That said, my unscientific test for WiFi association time (I.e turn off wifi on device, turn back on and reconnect) feels almost instant, definitely less than 500ms by a far margin on some devices with newer chips. Older devices on the other hand does take their sweet ass time. Interestingly, as far as I can see in my WiFi controller, unlike my iPads and iPhones, my light switches doesn\u2019t seem to go to sleep... that would explain their near instant reaction time. \n\nRe: motion sensor; my plans are POE occupancy sensor. Don\u2019t need WiFi if they\u2019re going to be attached to fixtures like ceilings. Also save a bunch of money on hard to replace button batteries. Don\u2019t want to rip things off the wall just to replace them batteries you know. \n\nI run everything via HomeKit. No vendor app or firmware hacking required. Open standards like HomeKit (where specifications can be downloaded directly from protocol vendor) ensures cross comparability and long term support. I can VLAN block off all my IOT devices so they have no internet access and they\u2019d still functional just fine remotely. \n\nI think the WiFi advancement is the biggest issue here. That said, I\u2019m also not too worried because 1) I can install some discrete in-wall 802.11ac access points to provide legacy support while running newer access points in their traditional ceiling mounted positions. Also 2) 802.11G is likely going to stay for the foreseeable future because of all the devices that\u2019s around today. We are still supporting a lot of B devices today, those are likely going to go before we see deprecation of G devices. \n\nAgain thanks for the lengthy reply. Definitely got me thinking about the WiFi issue. Next couple of AP I get will definitely be in wall 802.11ax AP so they can stay there and support my devices for the foreseeable future.",

                    "The long and short of it is that there are a lot of ways to deploy WiFi for your location. I'm honestly not an expert at mesh based WiFi, but my understanding is that Google WiFi, Eero, and alike falls in the mesh WiFi bucket, which is a bit better than repeater based WiFi in it will automatically figure out the best route to get back to the base station (whereas traditional repeater based WiFi is fixed route).\n\nI'm more familiar with switch and AP based setup, as hard-wired connections tend to be a lot better compared to wireless in that you don't need to worry about radio frequency being repeated multiple times (which causes longer delay), which is why multi-AP style setup are generally better than wireless deployments.\n\nFor home, I use Ubiquiti, which is cheaper (~$100 per AC wave1 access point; compared to Aerohive at around $175 per AC wave1 access point), at the expense of only having community support. For work, I'd recommend the usual suspects (Aruba from HP, Meraki from Cisco, etc.) and pay an arm and a leg because the premium offers much better support that would otherwise hurt work productivity. \n\nIf you're doing a brand new home setup today, for Ubiquiti, I'd say think whether or not you want 802.11ax (WiFi 6). \n\nIf you do want 802.11ax when it becomes available, I'd recommend going with something cheap and simple as a temporary measure as Ubiquiti's 802.11ax gears aren't out yet. Assuming North American dry-wall setup, about 1000 sqft of horizontal space should get an access point in central locations that can offer a lot of line of sight. On the budget end, I like UAP-AC-Lite because at $85 USD a pop MSRP, you can get an AC AP with a marketing claim of 250 concurrent clients (should be able to do ~100 realistically without too much delay), so 2 to 3 of them for a 2000~3000 sqft house, you'd be looking at &lt; $300, which you can swap out for 802.11ax gears when those get released (sell the UAP-AC-Lite in the aftermarket later to recoupe some as well).\n\nIf you don't care about 802.11ax right now, the NanoHD ($179 MSRP) or UAP-AC-HD ($349 MSRP) both does wonders. I am using 2 NanoHD at home right now as the backbone for my 30+ light switches in the above example. I get 1ms ping from client to AP throughout the 2-floor townhouse, and get 600Mbps on SpeedTest.net from my AppleTV -- this is of course with all the light switches still being on the network supposedly slowing the network down according to Z-Wave proponents -- on my 750Mbps fibre connection. I can forgo the 150Mbps because honestly, streaming 4K contents is probably going to be the most bandwidth intensive thing that I'll be doing aside from work (hardwired server), and at 600Mbps, I can pull an entire 3-hour movie down in less than 6 minutes, so I won't be yearning for more speed. I do fully plan to switch to 802.11ax gears when they become available, because I think as I acquire even more WiFi gears moving forward, and as they gain 802.11ax support, the performance will be able to gain benefits over time. Of course, when I make this transition, I'll put my NanoHD on to aftermarket to recoup some of the expenses as well.\n\nHope this helps!",

It's not their reconnect time that's the issue, because they receive rather than originate the commands.  It's not impossible (Blink makes it work), but it's definitely the worst-case scenario for WiFi and I suspect it's the reason most IoT blinds that can be run from battery tend to use some other wireless protocol along with a WiFi bridge.

IoT vendors have shown that [they can and will remote \"update\" your device to remove APIs](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/a7rs29/a_year_after_logitech_screwed_over_harmony_users), something that stems from a lack of standardization at the application layer for WiFi-connected IoT devices.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love WiFi for the right use case, but I run Z-Wave for most of my core home automation devices (lighting control, motion and open/close sensors, locks) for which I want high reliability, broad platform support, local device association, and with flexible power options.",

                    "&gt; every hop requires the radio to receive and retransmit the signal back out, which adds delay. If you have good WiFi setup properly blanket the coverage area, then the response time could be much faster than that of a repeated signal.\n\nWe're talking milliseconds here.  If I push the button and the light comes on in 100ms instead of 10ms, I probably won't notice the difference.  I don't think that extra latency is a serious tradeoff when the mesh coverage is the benefit.  \n\n&gt; A Zigbee/ZWave hub can essentially be thought of as a physical VLAN tagged port. Setting up devices in their own isolated VLAN and block out internet access is privacy steps that should be taken regardless of how things are implemented.   \n\nNot quite.  Z-Wave devices don't get raw Internet access.  They can't initiate connections out to external servers or accept connections from the outside other than commands like on/off/status.  They aren't tiny little computers running embedded network OSes; they don't have vulnerabilities of the sort that could be network exploited and even if they did have Z-Wave protocol weaknesses that would at most grant access to the rest of the Z-Wave network (but such a thing is nearly impossible).  And when you plug a Z-Wave device in for the first time, it won't celebrate that fact by immediately reaching out to some crappy cloud server.  \nPoint is- VLAN isolated or not, there's a much smaller target / threat profile from a Z-Wave device than a WiFi device.  \nBesides, most people don't know how to do VLANs or firewalls.  \n\n&gt; For my WiFi devices, most of them follow the open HomeKit standard from Apple  \n\nThose are not the devices I'm talking about.  I don't like HomeKit's relatively closed ecosystem, but from what I've read of the protocol its security and privacy controls are quite good, and compatibility within the HomeKit ecosystem is also good.  \nThe devices I'm talking about are things like WiFi light bulbs that use some random vendor's app and cloud connection.",

                    "Not really.  The main issue with these devices is their \"end device aging\" value built into the Xiaomi profile.  Its basically a time out value.  In the Xiaomi world, it is much larger than it is for the 1.2HA profile.  So the Xiaomi devices don't check in as frequently as a normal 1.2HA profile device would (which is most certainly the reason these devices have incredible battery life compared to similar devices).  Zigbee HA1.2 expects devices to check in every so often (I think its 30 minutes, but don't quote me on that).  Per the HA1.2 profile standard, after 3 missed check-ins, the device is booted from the mesh and is not allowed to rejoin.  So if the end device aging is 60 minutes for xiaomi and only 30 minutes for Zigbee HA1.2, if the device checks in at 1:00, then misses at 2:00, it won't check in again until 3:00.  The zigbee HA1.2 mesh expects it to check in at 1:00, 1:30, and at 2:00.  Since it doesn't get that check in, it gets kicked off the mesh and the device needs to be repaired to the hub manually.\n\nSmartThings, several firm ware revisions ago, provided an update to the hubs to allow for the longer end aging device time out.  So if the Xiaomi device is connected to the hub directly, it can miss a checkin or two and when it comes back, the hub will still allow for it.  However, if the Xiaomi device is connected to the mesh through a repeater that follows the standard HA1.2 profile, if the Xiaomi device misses a couple of check-ins, the repeater will kick it off the mesh and the device won't come back online.\n\nAll of this is entirely independent of the device handler, you can't write a device handler to manage the protocol.  The protocol is built into the firmware of the devices themselves.  So yes, there are custom device handlers that work well and reliably....all the way up until they don't.\n\n",

I got more done to automate my house the first weekend that I switched to [Indigo](http://indigodomo.com) than I had in the previous year.\n\nIt took moving to another system to realize just how awful many of the design decisions of ST are. My list is quite long:\n\n* Cloud based\n\n* No built in rules engine\n\n* No built in web page building, and what exists 3rd party is VERY limited compared to other systems, especially what I moved to.\n\n* The online community at the time was all \"well if a smartApp doesn't do what you want, just code it yourself in Groovy.\"\n\n* The SmartApp model is ridiculous--a crutch thrown at the system after the bone-headed choice to not have a built in rules engine. Result is you need multiple SmartApps to do what you want with any given device. I also once was advised by ST support to delete a device and re-add it to get it working. Well guess what, it was part of FOURTEEN different SmartApps. That took a damn long time, and then I had to add it back!\n\n* No real logging. You have to turn logging on BEFORE you want to see the log. So dumb. When I notice a problem I want to go see what caused it, not go turn on the log so I can see next time.\n\n* No Desktop client\n\n* ST forum users back in the day were all \"just code it yourself\" every time there was a question about how to do something no SmartApp allowed.\n\n* No integration with Mac OS, which allows tremendous superpowers.\n\n* Clunky 3rd party iTunes support\n\n* But #1: **reliability was truly terrible.** Unbelievably bad. I used ST during what was apparently the year of hell, where multiple developers for the platform all pulled their plugins in protest. (I hear this is better now but don't care, I'm done with ST.) I recognized some of these failings while I was using it obviously. But I didn't truly realize how awful the user experience is until I switched to Indigo.

There are cheaper options out there, but you often get what you pay for.   \n\nI have ST and I think it's great, especially with third party add-ons like Stringify or WebCore.   But I would put some research into the ST fob before you let that convince you to buy a hub, it's not without it's issues.

I suppose if you're walking then it's a bit of a boost, but even on a bike that's just a couple mins, seems it's probably not worth the hassle.\n\nPersonally, I'd either set up a simple voice activated command on my phone that I could simply tell it I'm coming home once I'm done at work.  Or try to automate it bit more with some sort of switch, be it an Amazon button in my locker at work, something as part of my work computer shutdown routine, or something in my car or bike.\n\nHaving it go down to 18C when you leave is easier, since you have more things at home to trigger a routine.  The easiest by far is a security system, since you activate it every time you leave.  But there are tons of options; like monitoring when your phone leaves the WiFi network (and/or pair that with geofencing for more accuracy), or a smart lock or just an Amazon button by the door.   Which takes us back to the original topic of the thread...  you need a hub if you want more than just basic Alexa routines. ",

But, once you start growing and making things more customized, local control quickly goes out the window.\n\nWith that said, I don't think its as much of a \"must\" as you think it is.  Cloud based executions are generally sub 1 second for response times.  The difference in delay between local and cloud is typically not even noticeable.  Worse case scenario, is 1, maybe a 2 second delay and that's rare.

I leave that to the reader.\n3. Search yourself on [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if any credentials belonging to you have been compromised, and if so, take immediate remediation steps to change your passwords.\n4. Keep your router firmware up to date, and periodically check it to see if the firmware is up to date.\n5. If you have kids, or just want to be safe, consider a subscription to a Internet Security protection, like via Bitdefender etc. Also, consider a router that has parental controls.\n\nMedium difficulty wins:\n\n1. Invest in PiHole, which at this point might tow the line between beginner-friendly, but with all the guides and videos and tutorials, you may be able to set this up. It may not provide complete security itself, but it can provide some metric son the websites you are building.\n\nHard mode wins:\n\n1. The term \"air gapped\" describes a state of being where you have literally no \\[network\\] connectivity into the big scary place called the Internet. However, the caveat is that for services that offload any functionality, like Arlo, this is not feasible. So your next best bet is isolating networks that need extra protection. For this, you can learn about home networking systems and switches that provide VLANs (virtual local-area-networks), which in simple terms provide a way to isolate networks that don't need to talk to each other. So, you could set up your IoT devices, like your camera and monitor, on a network isolated from Internet and Guest. This is super simplified, and is not trivial.

Into your very home you\u2019re knowingly bringing (and paying for) little computers with microphone arrays specifically designed to hear your whisper across the room with music blaring at full volume and cameras competing for the widest possible cover and boasting the ability to see in full darkness by way of IR illumination.\n\nA $40 Xiaomi Hualai has two sensors that\u2019ll give you a complete 360 degree sphere of cover.\n\nBut.\n\nThink about who really gives a shit about a video of you falling asleep on the couch with a beer bottle.  Or at what times your toilet motion sensor is triggered and for how long.\n\nProfessionals will hack you anyway - do you got something important that would make that effort worth their while?\n\nAmateurs and evil Chinese intelligence services? You eliminate 99% of these threats by changing admin/admin to admin/admin123 on your router.\n\nFor that rare sofa sex experience, with age these things tend to be less and less spontaneous so you get plenty of time to unplug the camera well in advance.\n\n... or plug it in, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing \ud83e\udd23.... If she shows up at all.\n\nYou\u2019ve already voluntarily gave Facebook and Google your address book, your family photos, your browsing habits, your emails (\u201carchive\u201d instead of \u201cdelete\u201d, remember?), and logs of your late night drunken messenger exchanges.\n\nSo going 100% luddite for fear of someone stealing that last piece they don\u2019t yet know may be a tad too late.

Nonetheless, several factors come into play that make this technology a great asset. For instance, if you have to keep checking up on your kids or elderly parents, who may not be very familiar with technology, then you will be grateful for having access to this excellent piece of technology.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Nucleus fulfills almost all the capabilities you would expect from an intercom. It comes with a modest touchscreen and a camera that allows you to make voice or video calls. Thanks to Nucleus, it\u2019s possible to communicate from one device to another, regardless of whether one of the devices is located in a separate home. Communications with phones through the app is also very much possible. What\u2019s more, Nucleus is compatible with Alexa, thereby allowing you to make calls and take advantage of Alexa\u2019s numerous capabilities using your voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompared to other smart home devices, Nucleus is a little bit expensive; however, it\u2019s cheaper and simpler to use compared to most tablets. That\u2019s mainly because it doesn\u2019t come with many of the tablet functionalities. Let you not be fooled, however, by the Alexa capabilities and big touchscreen into thinking that this is a good multitasking tool. It still remains an intercom and does what it\u2019s meant to do, even though it includes a few extras. Nonetheless, if you are certain you really need an intercom in your smart home, then it\u2019s worth giving the Nucleus a shot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Preparing For a Chat**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA simple 8-inch touchscreen and a giant camera lens means you can never go wrong with the Nucleus intercom, as far as chatting is concerned. It incorporates a stand for effortless propping up on a desk. The problem, however, is that it\u2019s difficult to adjust the stand\u2019s angle to achieve the best possible view of the room. The Nucleus can easily be mounted on the wall, thanks to the necessary brackets that it comes with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe device automatically boots up once you plug it in. You are then prompted to key in your Wi-Fi info and wait as it downloads the recent updates. Thereafter, it will take you through a brief tutorial, so you can set up your account and get right into business. For your username, you will need to enter your email. Other necessary details include a room name for the device, your family name, and your name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the verification process, you will receive a \u201cHome Code\u201d. If you set up multiple devices, you can move right ahead to keying in the room name by entering the provided code. Note that you will need more than one device, if you are looking forward to using it as an intercom system. But if you are mainly using it to check in with your kids or elderly parents, then one device is sufficient. That\u2019s because Nucleus works well with your smartphone through the Nucleus app for Android and iOS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Calling**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe primary advantage of the Nucleus over the several free chat apps available for your smartphone comes to the fore when you use the device to call another. You don\u2019t get to wait for the person on the other end to pick up before you can connect. Simply press the voice or camera icon for one device. The receiving device then automatically picks up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can have a chat with your elderly parents, check on a room, or make a quick announcement. All this is possible without the receiver touching the screen. The fact that this functionality is possible with the mobile app as well means you can remotely check on your home without requiring anybody to pick up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best thing about this feature is that you can easily turn it off if you are concerned about the privacy implications. Tap the Privacy button to change the settings, so you have to pick up to receive inbound calls. Also tap the Do Not Disturb icon if you don\u2019t wish to pick up any calls at all. There\u2019s even a physical shutter that easily slides over the camera if you\u2019d like to be 100 percent certain about your privacy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalling from the Nucleus device to a smartphone, on the other hand, is not instant. The call won\u2019t even go through if the app on your cell phone is closed. You can only be notified of an incoming call when the Nucleus app is open, even in the background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Remote Connection**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemote connection allows you to get in touch with other Nucleus users. However, remote connections don\u2019t connect instantly, and don\u2019t give you access to all the devices in your home. In settings, it\u2019s possible to send a unique code to a friend via email to share an individual device. Once your friend feeds in the code, you\u2019ll be asked to approve the connection, after which you can see each other via the remote tab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Quality of the Call**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore often than not, the clarity of sound and video when making a call largely depends on the stability and speed of your internet connection. Nevertheless, you can never get crystal-clear HD even when the device is at its best. The connection is, however, serviceable, and you will be able to hear and see what\u2019s happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Verdict**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are only interested in purchasing the Nucleus Smart Home Intercom just for the touchscreen, the Ring (which surrounds the massive camera lens), or Alexa, then you\u2019ve got it all wrong. The truth is that even if you factor in these features together with its prime function of making and receiving video calls, you still get a device that does not outdo a smartphone in terms of its usefulness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, if you have kids or elderly parents that you always want to check up on, especially if the auto-answer feature would be exceptionally useful, then purchasing this device makes a lot more sense. Furthermore, the additional integrations qualify it as a pretty solid purchase.\n\nSource:[https://techsmartest.com/nucleus-smart-home-intercom-review/](https://techsmartest.com/nucleus-smart-home-intercom-review/)",

I have been looking at various lights, smart plugs, lamps, etc. Do you guys know of any affordable products to make this room more 'smart'. The room already contains a Sony Android based smart TV so that's a start. The light bulbs are GU10 'spotlight' LEDs that are built into the ceiling. I would like to avoid having any 'hubs' if possible.\n\nI'm also concerned about the privacy implications of Google Home and Amazon Echo, but maybe someone here can convince me otherwise?\n\nThe sorts of things I am looking for:\nLamps\nLights\nDimmer Switches\nPlugs\nSensors\nand any other affordable gadgets.

It always does what I want and is local.\n\nThe smart home market is full of bugs, incompatibilities, and johnny-come-latelies.  It's a maze.  Some people here enjoy navigating that and coming up with clever solutions, but I just want cool stuff.  Now I have all manner of hubs, smart bulbs, switches, and remotes in a box-of-shame in my basement--more stuff than I have installed right now--and while I learned a lot I also wasted a lot of money.",

                    "There are options out there for people that are concerned with privacy or who want to keep everything local.  But that  requires significantly more knowledge and setup, and conflicts with your desire to not have a hub.  Amazon and Google have very user friendly options - it's what they do - allowing people to avoid getting hubs and having things more or less 'plug n play'.   And of course, there are significantly fewer options for peripherals and what you can do with home automation, if you stick to just Google or Amazon.  Then there are the privacy concerns for those that are worried about it.  I won't get into that, but just a point to think about - your phone is far more power than most hubs, and possesses all the ability to spy on you that home automation does, arguably far more.\n\nI think [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is the current champion when it comes to local run home automation.  It seems to have a pretty large following for support and development.  Like I said, it requires more upfront to get it up and running, but once you do it is far more capable than most other options out there.\n\nAs to affordable, might as well drop that wish now, home automation costs money.  But you can minimize costs by going a route like Home Automation and using generic/budget peripherals instead of the big brand stuff.",

I've seen a lot of camera that support local storage, but everyone needs a cloud connection to display the live feed. I want to be able to watch the live feed also only locally if I want to, in part for privacy reasons and in part for futureproof.\n\nDoes anyone know of such cameras?

            "A question about hubs\nSo I'm new to smart home devices, though I've always had an interest in them. I recently picked up a TP Link Kasa smart bulb, and I love it so far. I even let my boyfriend change the color from several states away which I think is amazing. The bulb I use doesn't require a hub like Philips Hue, but I'm familiar with the 2 different technologies that hubs can use. I'm also aware that they minimize the strain on a router and make it easier to connect many devices together. \n\nSo I'm wondering if there's anything I can get later in the future that could do the same thing once I have more devices. I plan on having 2 bulbs, and 2 LED strips in my room eventually. My internet connection is DSL which is pretty unfortunate but I've not had many issues with my light disconnecting. Only on occasions when my power goes out or something which a quick on/off of my lamp gets things working again. I'd like to use the same bulbs for everything because I don't want to deal with using multiple apps, and I don't want to get an Echo or Home device for privacy reasons. Hopefully there's some device that can bridge all of these devices without me needing to buy all new bulbs as I really like the functionality and apps of my current bulb.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and offer any advice if you do.",

That means that you can change the lights without having access to the net.  I don't give my HS100s any access to the net at all, and I can still control those devices using my phone.

This place mostly filled with folks that have (or are planning to) install high-tech smart hub / smart locks.  So understand that the people you asked for feedback are probably not your target audience.\n\nNow having said that, since you're targeting lower tech users with a simple solution, having a smartphone requirement for it to work is going to be a hindrance.  You're targeting folks who are not already in the \"smarthome\" sphere with a light up key.  So the smartphone requirement is going to exclude a lot of potential consumers (kids, seniors, etc) and adds a lot of complexity just to automate what is essentially a keylight on steroids (without the usability of a flashlight).\n\nAs I said, I think you're going to have an issue on SharkTank.  I'd be very surprised if they don't raise the same arguments before buying in as they are there to maximize the return on their investments and this is very much a niche product.  Those never do well on the show.",

I personally only have one key on my keychain and a key fob for my car. I dont see the need for it to illuminate since I dont need to distinguish it amongst multiple keys. However, this is just my personal situation so maybe others feel otherwise. \n\nAlso, keep in mind shark tank is just a reality tv show and it\u2019s far from real.

I have tried many, the reliability of these is just way better than the other brands I have used - $100 to start $50 per additional switch\nCamera depends on the functionality you want, if something basic I would do something cheap.

We installed a Google Home wifi 3-pack for coverage of the and 3 Google Home Mini's for voice control.  \n\nMy next plans are to add some Wyze Cams inside the house and get my mom setup with a Nest Hub Smart Display or the Lenovo 10\" smart display (maybe both).  Plan is to have all my siblings create shared photo albums in google photos and use them as auto-updating photo frames.  This will also give them another control point/interface for them to use everything.\n\nThe biggest thing was naming everything coherently and setting up routines for them ahead of time.

No separate app, no brower hunting for setup screens.

            "New Home - What\u2019s The Most Needed Smart Home Item\nHello! My wife and I are in the process of purchasing a home. Our closing date is set for March and this will be our first home. We are lucky enough to purchase a new construction home (1450 sq ft / single floor) and I want to make it slowly but surely a smart home. We will have my little brother and her little sister staying with us during their last year of college to save them money avoiding on-campus living and additional student loans... and I have an IMPORTANT QUESTION...\n\nWhat should my first purchase for my smart home be in my situation? (I\u2019m not trying to have a major smart home but things that benefit not showcase, if you catch my drift)\n\nAll my devices are Apple (MacBooks, iPhone, Apple TV, Etc) and everyone staying in the home use Apple devices as well.\n\nShould I purchase a smart key, security system, doorbell video, smart thermostat?\nWhich purchase would give me the most value?\n\nMy assumption right now is buy a August 3rd Gen Pro + Connect smart key and a Ecobee 3 Lite with 3 sensors for all 3 bedrooms. The smart key because I won\u2019t have to buy keys and worry about people losing them + get the ability to monitor all the ins and outs of the front door. The other purchase would be the thermostat to save money on electricity all while keeping it comfortable for everyone.\n\nThoughts? Is Nest a better option long term? My job uses Nest and Yale keys at our office and I love the security system. Which is why I wanted to do the smart home anyways.\n",

                    "Welcome to home automation! A lot of things arent exactly the most aesthetically pleasing. Smart plugs can be bulky, smart bulb switches may have to be installed alongside your existing switches, and tons of small plastic boxes for hubs and sensors. Generally you can hide most of them (hubs in a network closet/cabnet, plugs behind furniture, custom wall plates to integrate smart bulb switches better) but the ones where you can't, the convenience factor heavily outweighs any \"ugly factor\" for me.  \n\nNest thermostat is about the same in terms of functionality as the Ecobee now that Nest has temperature sensors too so that's no big change. Not sure if older models are compatible with them or not, they're pretty new. \n   \nIf you plan on sticking with August smart locks, they are retrofitted to existing locks. If you're changing the locks to one that's compatable, it's not a huge deal. If you were set on getting something like a Schlage smart lock that replaces the existing lock, it would be a waste of money to have to replace the locks twice.",

                    "This is a lot longer than I expected but I covered the very basics. There is a lot out there and with proper automation software, your imagination and budget are the limit. I've tried to keep things on the practical side.   \n     \nMost value would be smart thermostat but it isn't what I would buy first. First thing I'd look at are the various home automation hub software like Smartthings, Home Assistant, or Homekit. This way, if you do decide to have some automation/control between devices, they will be compatible. Since you have a majority of apple products, Homekit, is a good choice. I have no experience with Homekit but I see it recommended for Apple households. I personally use Home Assistant because I don't have any Apple products and it has really broad compatibility. The down side is it has a very steep learning curve. If you plan on using a voice assistant, make sure your devices are compatible. Automation software, like IFTTT, Stringify, Home Assistant, etc, is also something to keep in mind. A lot of my most useful smart home functionality comes from automation software.    \n      \nI'd do the locks first, since you should be changing them anyway when you buy a new house. I prefer ones with external key pads so I can give temporary access with a code if someone needs to watch my house while I'm away and I don't have to worry about keys (I still carry one just in case the keypad dies but it usually gives you ample warning). I think they have a separate keypad for August. Not sure though. You may have to worry about people losing the smart key if you have to worry about them losing regular keys so a keypad is another plus here.     \n           \nIf you plan on getting a home security system right away, then get that next. No point in buying something that you plan to replace and have to change out all the sensors. I didn't plan on getting one so I can't really recommend any tips for this one. If your home security systems of choice doesn't have leak sensors, pick up compatible ones. They're great for avoiding water damage. This is more important for leaky basements but useful for under sinks and sump pumps too. Smart Smoke detectors might fall under this category too. I know nest makes one. Not sure if there are other good ones. Having these connected to smart bulbs/switches is good for waking people up in an emergency.       \n      \nIf you don't plan on getting a home security system right away, then go smart thermostat instead. The only difference between the Ecobee 4 and Ecobee 3 is the built in Alexa. If you plan on getting into Alexa devices, then the 4 is a good choice. Otherwise go with the 3. They're usually around the same price. Nest has sensors now if you prefer Nest. I prefer the Ecobee, but if you're going Nest security system, might as well go Nest for the thermostat too.    \n          \nAfter that I'd start on lights. Video doorbells are nice but you'll get more use out of lights. You don't have to do them all in one go. Wait for sales and add them as needed. Decide if you want smart bulbs or smart switches.   \n       \nSmart bulbs are easier to install and offer color. I prefer Hue bulbs since they're compatible with most smart devices and hubs. I have color Hues in my entertainment areas since I find that dark blues and purples reduce glare on the TV the most. They have warmer oranges too which I use before going to sleep to help me relax. Colors are in the bedroom too for the same reason. I have white bulbs in places I don't need color like hallways, bathrooms, outside, and the basement. I try to stay away from wifi bulbs so they don't congest my network. It should be fine if you have a few but 30+ might be too much for your router. I have an 1800sq 2 story house with a basement and detached garage. I have 35 and counting smart bulbs. They add up fast.          \n    \nSmart switches are harder to install because they completely replace the old switches but they're easier to use since they work like regular switches. Most people on this sub prefer smart switches. I use smart bulbs because I like color so I can't make any recommendation on switches.   \n      \nAt the same time as lights, look at smart plugs for anything that can't be automated by bulbs or switches. They're also useful for in-window air conditioners, indoor Chirstmas lights, small lamps, etc. Pretty much anything that will be 'on' if it is unplugged and plugged back in. If you use it for space heaters, make sure to check the maximum wattage rating of the plug first.      \n    \nRobo vacuums are handy for daily vacuuming but you will still need to run a manual one every few weeks. They do help keep dirt to a minimum though. I usually have mine run when I'm at work and clean out it's bin when I get home. Just make sure it has nothing to get stuck on when it runs. I'd get these after everything above though.       \n   \nDoorbell is the last think I'd get. its useful but less so than the other things on the list. I haven't gotten one so I have no recommendations or tips.",

The Echo Dot has native support for the smart plug, but the smart extension lead requires a third party app called Smart Life to be used to setup an account, and link that to Alexa. I think the plug is by Tuya. I already don't like the messing around with the Smart Life app, and would rather just have everything as simple as it can be.\n\nI would like to progress into smart lighting, security such as door/window contacts, cameras, thermostats etc. but figured lighting is the best place to start. I originally looked at Philips Hue, but they are pretty expensive and require their own hub (unless you get an Echo + which acts as a Zigbee hub from what i've read). I want to avoid having multiple hubs, but also where possible having hubs/devices that are reliant upon the cloud. I have already read about SmartThings going down and maintenance causing outages for people's smart homes - not cool.\n\nSo if anyone can help me figure out what I am best doing, please let me know. If anyone can also explain how the plugs I have connect to Alexa, that would be appreciated.\n\nI have listed some things below that I have read about and my thoughts on them:\n\nSmartThings - good idea in principle (support for ZWave and Zigbee), but the cloud communication is a drawback\nHome Assistant - good idea, but how does it work with voice control, and how difficult is it to integrate everything into one app?\nLightwaveRF - better concept than smart light bulbs and smart plugs, but very expensive and even if I got an Echo Plus, I would still need the LightwaveRF bridge?\nHive - Not as much support for light bulb styles as Philips Hue, but much cheaper and also has a product range with cameras, leak sensors, thermostat etc.\nPhilips Hue - good quality, basically the most iconic smart light bulb, but expensive. Only integrates with Nest (which I know little about).",

                    "Welcome to the smart home world! As you can see, it's a bit of a mess at the moment. I would highly recommend that you select a hub now and stick to devices it supports, as well as avoiding Wifi-based devices like the ones you have mentioned. Smart Things and Home Assistant are two great options. SmartThings cloud isn't ideal, but I have found it to be relatively reliable and lag-free, personally. Home Assistant is more powerful and local, but don't underestimate the setup time required. It's a massive investment of time and effort. To your question, once set up everything will be available on a single webpage, and you can customize that further as needed. I found the voice control options to be a hassle and not work very well. They want to sell you their cloud subscription. If you don't mind a monthly sub, it's pretty hassle-free from what I hear.\n\nHue is great. Yes, it's expensive, but it's also a very high quality and well supported ecosystem. It also works great with most hubs, so you can control your Hue lights via HA, ST, etc. Ikea Tradfri is a nice Zigbee-based option if you're looking to save a few bucks.\n\nEcho Plus is a very limited hub. I would avoid it. It will not compare to ST or HA in terms of features, compatibility, etc. Let Echo act as your voice assistant, and get a proper hub to do the heavy lifting. It's also 100% reliant on the cloud. While ST will lose some functionality without internet, a lot of stuff is locally controlled and will still work. Not the case with Echo (though Echo plus may have local support I'm not aware of).\n\nIn terms of protocol, each has it's own pros and cons. Wifi is good for entry level because it does not require a hub, but the downsides are many. Wifi isn't a protocol that handles a lot of traffic well and most wifi devices will require a native app or use the cloud. Zigbee and Z-Wave are both mesh networks designed for home automation. As a result they tend to be more reliable, lower bandwidth and require less electricity (important for wireless devices). They're also both mesh networks, so devices that you add increase the range of your communication network. Between the two, Zigbee devices tend to be a bit less standardized, and cheaper. Z-Wave has the added benefit of being on a separate frequency (Zigbee shares the 2.4ghz band of Wifi), but will generally cost the most out of the three protocols. Most hubs will support all protocols, including ST and HA (with appropriate dongles).",

                    "I find myself switching from Smartthings (ST) and Home Assistant (HA) every two years or so, (just switched back to ST), and I'll paraphrase the old Windows/Linux conclusion:\n\nHome Assistant is the way you should go if you want a hobby. It ticks pretty much every single box you want:\n\n* You can design your own interface\n* You can get USB dongles for ZWave/Zigbee so you don't have hubs lying about\n* Works with tons of stuff and more gets added all the time\n* Runs locally\n* Works with Alexa and Google Assistant (I can only speak about the latter)\n   * Note: Costs $5/mo unless you set it up yourself\n* However:\n   * Presence detection is very flaky.\n\nIt's really comprehensive, cheap, versatile, and powerful. It's also a humongous time sink. They're getting MUCH better about it \"just working\" so I'm probably being a little harsher than they warrant if we extrapolate into the future, but this is not really going to be something you just set up and it works. Please note: I used HA and considered this a positive trait-- I *like* tinkering-- I'm just making you aware. Presence detection is very painful because there isn't a cross-platform native mobile app, like ST has, so you rely on all sorts of other methods, which I've found to be quite flaky even with their cool bayesian logic stuff. Nothing makes your wife look at you like you're an idiot like all the lights turning off during dinner because HA thought everyone left for 30 seconds, haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmartthings, on the other hand, just works, but is less versatile, powerful and customizable, and while it works with *a lot*, it doesn't come close to what HA supports. If you go this route, look into WebCore, which is how automation should have been handled by ST natively, but for reasons I really can't understand, isn't. It's the only reason I even entertain using ST at all, simplicity be damned. Presence detection, because of their cross-platform phone app, is pretty reliable. I also have some concerns with Samsungs takeover of ST; I'm not sure what's going on but they now have TWO phone apps and they don't have feature parity. Another thing, more of a note, is that ST-branded components are usually pretty expensive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, since you're just starting out, if you're still on the fence, I'd suggest going with HA first because of the low barrier to entry (A raspberry pi and an SD card \\~ $40) and if you go to buy components, at first, just make sure ST supports it, too. (There's several cool things you can do with a Raspberry Pi, if HA isn't your thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, and one last thing: Phillips Hue integrates with more than nest. In fact, I didn't even know it integrated with Nest.  It integrates with ST, HA, Logitech Harmony, IFTTT, Alexa, and Google Assistant off the top of my head. They are expensive, though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this wasn't a rambling mess!",

My biggest personal gripe with HA besides presence detection is that I, for some reason, really, really, really hate writing automations in yaml. I installed Node Red to handle that functionality, and it worked great-- but guides on how to use it were not very common, so I had to learn the old fashioned way-- trial and error. It may be better now, but even without Node Red, HA will work-- don't doubt that.\n\nST does support both protocols, as does HA with the caveat that you have to buy hardware for the RPi to get it. They both have USB dongles for this. \n\nIt's only my opinion, but when it comes to central hubs, ST and HA are the only real choices. It so happens that's also the only things I've used, so take that with a grain of salt. Either one is a good choice, as long as you know what you're getting in to.\n\nAs an aside, if you set up Subsonic and run pihole, you're probably going to have no trouble with HA. ",

Because people can create their own device handlers and smart apps the list of supported devices is massive, comparable only to Home Assistant. WebCoRE is a smartapp that allows complex automations, and is also highly recommended. One of the key ST things that's not well explained is the difference between versions of the hub and app. For the hub, v2 is technically more powerful than v3, and includes a built-in battery backup. v3, on the other hand, can sometimes be cheaper, and adds wifi support. Note that in this case that means the hub can be connected via wifi instead of ethernet. I DO NOT recommend using wifi, as that will add a layer of unreliability to all of your smart home stuff that you want to avoid. If you can live with a wired connection, and can find the v2 hub for a comparable/cheaper price to v3, it's recommended to do so. For the app, the new SmartThings app is still in development and is fairly limited. You should download the SmartThings Classic app and use that instead. If you go with a v3 hub you'll need the new app to pair to the hub, but after that you can switch.\n\nI'm not well versed in IFTTT since I've got a proper hub in place. My understanding is that Alexa isn't a THAT, no. Think of your Echo as a voice assistant, and not as a Hub. It can trigger routines, but devices cannot talk back to it. Look for the devices themselves (or Tuya/SmartLife in the case of the re-branded device) in IFTTT.",

It starts with a base schedule (that can be modified) and then when you change it throughout the weeks/months, it learns what times of the day you change the temp and what you change it to. It has a sensor on the device itself that detects activity in the home so it knows when to enter eco mode and when not to. Realistically, the only \"AI\" aspect to it is just programmed long-term learning algorithms, probably using data averages and whatnot (though I've not seen the nest code myself).   \n\n\nAnywho, what I'm getting at is that this approach can be applied to a lot of smarthome devices. A hub device could detect the presence of a homeowners cellphone being connected to the WLAN and parse out commands. I.E. you've been disconnected from the WLAN for x amount of time and currently the lights are off and the smart door lock is locked. You pull up in driveway, phone connects to your wifi. Hub notices the connection and the current light/door status and determines you just arrived home -&gt; unlocks door, turns on lights, turns HVAC system on.

The problem with implementing ML for presence detection is that each home automation setup is unique.  There are different data points for every home that could potentially be used.  This makes training a model that works for a majority of cases is very difficult.  Since every home has different inputs available, models would need to be trained for each individual home.  This would also require many thousands of datapoints for that specific case to train a model that would only work for that home.

I'd like to be able to automate the schedule for when they turn on, ideally using something like IFTTT or Stringify to trigger them when I leave the house for example.  \n\n\nAt first I thought the Blink XT cameras were going to be the way to go. They physically have a nice modern look instead of looking like bulky CCTV cameras. But it seems the Blink only records in short clips when it detects motion (30 second max) and most importantly, only stores 2 hours worth of video clips. So this really isn't the right product.  \n\n\nThe Arlo seems like it ticks all the boxes. Has a pretty nice physical design and offers different amounts of storage (up to 100GB for \u00a39.99 a month, more than enough to have a few cameras record whilst I'm out). So I think this might be the way to go.  \n\n\nAnybody have a better experience with an alternative product? Any suggestions appreciated!",

It was turning off and on by itself, without me giving it any signals. It would stop for up to 20 min sometimes, then go again. There wasn\u2019t a clear rhythm, and different sockets were being turned off and on individually.\n\nI thought maybe the wiring in this cheap product was just going, so I turned it off and went to sleep. This morning I woke up to a bunch of notifications from the app that controls this device - saying things like \u201cvoice command not working, device is offline\u201d. Yeah, I wasn\u2019t sending any voice commands.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to find more info on this product or the app. There isn\u2019t much, but from what I HAVE found, this app evidently requests tons of permissions before running on your phone, requires personal information to set up the device, sends an obscene amount of data to Chinese servers, and is riddled with security holes. I\u2019ve had it for over a year so I hardly remember setup, but now I definitely feel like an idiot.\n\nI\u2019m posting this partly so that it\u2019s visible to anyone planning to install the app and/or having issues with its associated products. But I\u2019m also wondering if anyone else seems to have similarly weird experiences they\u2019d share.\n\nAlternative theory to hacking: I now have a really tech-savvy house ghost.\n",

Lutron seems to be the way to go but there is something else that doesn't require an additional hub that would be great\n\n5) Integration with an Ecobee 3, which I haven't bought yet but its the thermostat I've been set on for a while.\n\nFor the next week there is a pretty good sale on for the Smartthings hub and I believe I can do everything I want to do with it, so if you guys think that I can meet my needs using that as my hub then I'll pick it up in the next day or two.\n\nFor the humidity / temperature sensor there don't seem to be too many options out there. It looks like the Xiaomi ones can be made to work, but I have never used a hub before. Will these just provide a reading or can I set up alerts with them and use it to trigger a smart plug?\n\nWater sensor, looks like Xiaomi is the way to go again, but there are lots of options.\n\nThe alarm I am potentially going with is the Honeywell Lyric system. I'd love to be able to check on the status of my doors and alarm from whatever hub I am using and maybe use the door sensors to trigger lights, but thats not a big deal.\n\nEcobee3 integration is easy and supported by the big hubs so that's not really a concern either way for me.\n\nSo - with what I'm looking to do, do these purchases make sense? I'd get the hub, humidity / temperature sensors right away, add on a water sensor before spring, home alarm system in the next month or so and switches and thermostat at some point in the future. The big thing is just grabbing the hub while its on sale, if Smartthings is going to be the best one for me.\n\nThanks!",

Could the SmartThings hub not handle all of this? \n\nThe Aqara sensors work with a device handler and I believe the Kasa plug does as well, but would happily switch out the plug for a SmartThings one or some other Z-Wave plug for ease of use.\n\nThe Ecobee sensors are four times the cost of the Aqara ones so if there is a compelling reason to look at them I would but it seems the Aqara ones should be fine. But again, I'm going by reading discussion threads and haven't actually used them or SmartThings before so I'm not 100% sure if they will do what I want.

Simply put, that's a lot of different systems to bridge together.  I do it all with an ISY994iZW for Insteon and Z-Wave, Polyglot (running on a VM but can also do a RPI) for IP based devices, and I'm adding in an Elk M1 security system that also has two-way control to the ISY, so I have all of the functionality you mention with a minimum of controllers and hubs.  And since the ISY doesn't have a mobile app, I'm doing a third party app for all of that.  Minimum of hubs, but I'm going to be straight about this: it's not trivial to set up.

Not looking to do a full multi-camera security system (yet!)\n\nInterested in thoughts on things like just using Philips Hue bulbs being directly controlled by Alexa rather than also getting a smart lightswitch to add (more?) control over them, etc. Basically want to know if I'm making any newbie mistakes before I outlay about $1,400 for all this gear.

Meaning if you or your wife accidentally turn off the lights with the switch, they won't be reachable by your phone or alexa, and you'll need to flip the switch back on. \n\nThis may not sound annoying, but it really is. Additionally, relying only on Alexa to turn your lights on, gets really old really fast. When you walk into your bedroom to just grab something quickly, and having to say \"alexa, turn on the bedroom lights\" every time gets far too frustrating. \n\nIt's also awful for guests, they'll lose their minds trying to use anything in your house. \n\nRemember that with smart homes, your goal should be convenience. If it doesn't add convenience, then don't do it. \n\nIf you are really hell bent on having the colors lights everywhere, do yourself a favor and get a Hue Dimmer Remote ([https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Dimmer-Switch-Installation-Free-Exclusively/dp/B076MGKTGS/ref=sr\\_1\\_5?keywords=hue+dimmer+switch&amp;qid=1548078084&amp;sr=8-5](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Dimmer-Switch-Installation-Free-Exclusively/dp/B076MGKTGS/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=hue+dimmer+switch&amp;qid=1548078084&amp;sr=8-5)) for each room.\n\nThey can be programmed with 3rd party apps (such as iConnectHue) to do whatever you want. This way you're not relying on alexa to turn on your lights every time, and you can just hit a button somewhat normally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've also found that the full color lights tend to be a little gimmicky after a while, and you'll set your ceiling lights to just normal white/yellow 90% of the time. For the fun color options, I've found that the accent lights like Go and Play Bar's are far more fun and add more flair to the room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for your multi-room audio question, what devices are you playing the music through? Can they be paired via bluetooth to the echo's? You can do multi-room audio to each echo device, which will then play to whatever bluetooth speaker they're connected to. ",

We are planning on getting a Nest thermostat down the road and a smart lock for the front door but those are not priority purchases.\n\nI'm considering a Ring spotlight cam (battery powered about $250 CAD) or a solar powered floodlight (which I can get for as little as $40 CAD)  and separate camera since the location I need to cover has no electrical nearby and I'm not sure how soon I could hire an electrician.  My issue is I'm not sure what other camera I could get that would give me the notifications like I get from my doorbell (I need the notification plus the ability to download the video) and come in cheaper than just getting the Ring spotlight.   We haven't purchased too many devices for our home yet (and I don't have enough time/energy to get into custom coding/raspberry pi style automation just yet) so I'm not too worried about sticking with Ring if another product is better, etc (but Ring has a security system that we might be interested in now).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny suggestions and recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Some of them have an ac power option.

            "Stay away from Vivint!\nJust want to share a horror story about Vivint.\n\nIn 2013 I got a knock on the door by a salesman representing Vivint.  I was actually thinking about security systems at the time, so I listed to him.  One of the things I asked was what would happen if we had to relocate due to a job change.  I knew at the time that there was a pretty good chance that we would have to move due to my wife's work.  He told me it would be no problem and we could cancel.  He also said that the security system would help when we go to sell the house and that the new owner could simply take over the account.\n\nFast forward 3 years from then (2016) and sure enough, we had to move for my wife's work.  So the new home buyer said he would take over the system and I called vivint to see what I needed to do to make that happen.  They made it sound like they just needed the new buyer to contact them and setup the account.  I passed the info on to the realtor and dealt with all the other home selling/moving related issues I had to deal with at that time.\n\nUnfortunately, we closed on the house and the new buyer never followed through with the takeover.  So at that point, I had no access to the house and couldn't get the equipment out.  I tried through the realtor to get the system components, but the new buyer never responded to the realtor.\n\nYou would think at that point, after explaining the situation to Vivint that they might be a little sympathetic.  Not at all.  Even though their website at the time stated that they understand life happens and you may need to cancel under certain circumstances, they wouldn't budge.  Basically said we were on the hook for the remaining $1,200 left on the contract.  I actually continued to pay on the account for almost a year after moving because I didn't know what to do.  We moved into a rental unit, which, of course, doesn't want some crappy vivint system.  So I had no way to transfer the account.\n\nAfter a certain point, I just couldn't justify paying $49.99 a month for something that I'm not able to use.  So I just stopped paying.  They sent it to collections, and now, in 2018, I get a ding on my credit for it.\n\nImagine I come to your house and knock on your door and offer to mow your grass for 60 months @ $50 per month.  You agree, and then 3 years into our agreement, you get relocated to a NYC apartment (no grass).  Then I come after you for $1,200 which is what you would have had to pay me over the next 2 years for mowing your grass.  Sound fair?\n\nThat's exactly what Vivint did.  They expected to be paid for services they didn't render.  I didn't agree to pay them $3,000 over 60 months for no reason.  I expected something in return for that money.  Once they could no longer fulfill their side of the agreement, why do they think they're entitled to free money?  \n\nThankfully, when I signed the agreement I refused to sign up for automatic payments.  They sales guy was pushy about this, but I finally told him that if he insisted that I give him my CC# the deal was off.  He agreed to alter the contract on the spot and hand wrote on the agreement that I would be billed monthly.  So they never got authorization for automatic drafts from my bank/cc.  They were pushy about this for the next 3 years too.  I had to be really careful not to agree to automatic payments.  Thank god I never did that because I've read all the reviews where they continue to auto draft people even after the contract is cancelled.\n\nAnyway, their billing department is completely incompetent and useless.  They will hold you to the payment agreement no matter what happens to you.  Dealing with them is the worst experience I've ever had with a business.  By far the worst customer service experience I've ever encountered.\n\nMultiple state attorney generals have settlements against vivint for their business practices.  I've contacted mine to see if there is any help they can provide.  I do live in a state where they had a settlement last year.  Unfortunately for me, I was never notified about it, and I just learned about the settlement recently.  \n\nI really hope karma comes knocking for these scammers.  The number of people they've ripped off and put through hell is astounding.  They shouldn't be allowed to operate a lemonade stand, let alone a large security company.\n\nI beg anyone reading this to never, ever do business with vivint in any way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nF vivint",

I'm going to need a printed copy and some time to look this over\" \"well do you have a printer?\" \"no, i'm going to need a night or a couple days, have my lawyer check it over, etc.\" (his face drops)\n\n\"well if you're worried about the price, we can do it for &lt;some other price that was less per month&gt;\" \"sorry, i'm not going to sign a 5 year contract worth thousands of dollars without time for my lawyer to look it over\" \"but you said you were worried about break-ins!\" \"lets not forget, it is YOU who came to MY door\"\n\n&lt;as he's leaving&gt; \"can I have your card so I can reach out?\" (now, every legitimate salesman would love to make a deal today, but they'll sure as heck make a deal tomorrow over not making one at all) \"no sorry, the deal is only good now\" \"Do you want a beer?\" \"no\" (leaves)\n\nSo Lets run down what happened here:  \n- tried to make me feel like i was special with the \"model customer\" crap  \n- tried to ascertain and play up my own fears  \n- tried and failed to identify possessions I might be afraid of getting stolen  \n- conveniently downplayed the solution I have in place which would be reasonable for almost all scenarios  \n- used my responses of what things cost to try to anchor discussion and charge what he thought he could get, even though the numbers I gave were knowingly absurd  \n- tried to pull a storage price out of his ass against someone who worked in the industry  \n- sold me on a neighborhood watch utopia which would only reasonably work if everyone in the neighborhood bought in  \n- came up with \"X$ value\" which was absurd for almost every component in the system, makes final total seem like a deal  \n- covered total price by listing only monthly payments  \n- price suddenly can come down more when I balk  \n- wouldn't make a sale tomorrow....because they know their deal is shit, and if you look anywhere, you'll find a better one  \n- tried to flip the tables and make is seem like i was the one desperate for a security system, instead of him being desperate to sell it\n\nBe aware of the tactics people like this use, identify them, and don't ever buy in. Ever. You get nothing by accepting the deal under duress. I guarantee if I called up vivint the next day, I could have gotten a similar deal. The only reason someone pressures you to make an immediate deal is because they know you'll realize you're getting screwed if you take the time to think about it.  \n",

Among them all, I got the Turtle Beach's\u2122.\n\nhttps://www.turtlebeach.com/products/z22-ear-cushion?variant=7763493453868\n\nI'm not even sure if it's exactly that one, been a few years, it should be. It's not leathery but made of cloth, much more comfortable than the default ones. I'm sure there are better   pads but they do the job.\n\nSecond online suggestion was to get some kind of cushion because the square bumps on the headband were hard on my head. Examples of potential softer headband covers:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=headphone+headband+cover&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aheadphone+headband+cover\n\nI didn't want to spend again so I just wrapped it around with a microfiber cloth. \n\nOh yeah, you have to be very careful with it as it's very easily breakable because of the plastic. It could withstand one drop but more than that and your odds of breaking them dangerously go up.\n\nI dropped mine couple of times and one pad just stuck out at 90 degrees on its side because the headband near the pad shattered. The sound was still 100% good but the pad was not able to rest on my ear. I tried to glue it back but it was too much of a hassle.\n\nI contacted Monoprice, told them about my uncarefulness and was ready to buy another one since I was really sincerely satisfied with their headphones and... they just sent me another one FOR FREE! Wow, I was blown away!\n\nI've been extra, extra careful with it ever since.\n\nThat was my cool Monoprice dj headphone story. \u263b",

They\u2019re \u201camazing\u201d, but the ear pads are uncomfortable, the headband is uncomfortable and they break very easily. If youre buslying these ourely for their sound wuality and inexpensive price, I\u2019m sure you could find much better headphones for slightly more money. In my opinion, headphones are a full experience, they have to sound good, feel good and be made of good quality materials. But maybe I\u2019m just different. ",

I saw the Mijia door sensor and the aqara motion sensor could be what I'm looking for, but I'm imagining some problems.\n\nI would avoid the door sensor since I would also want to shut off the light when I exit the room, and if I don't close the door that won't happen. The other way, if I enter with the door open, the light won't power on. There could be many other variables happening during the day also.\n\nSo I saw the aqara motion sensor, to power on and off lights when I'm actually or not in the room. The thing is, I don't know how this sensor works. Does it only detect movement? So that if I stay still in my room for a while it will power off lights? Does it recognize me instantly? Or it's more suitable for a \"touch and go\" room? (like a closet)\n\nIf neither of them is the right way to go, which one would be?",

                    "This is probably one of the most sought-after automation ideas for most folks, but it's not an easy target to execute well.\n\nFirst, I strongly suggest starting with public spaces and restrooms instead of a bedroom, since bedrooms are one of the hardest to automate well (the occasional misfires in the middle of the night will make you give it up, trust me).\n\nSome approaches and tricks that might be helpful:\n\n* Xandem ([xandem.com](https://xandem.com)) is one of the only solutions I know of that seem like they might actually be able to do direct presence detection. Having said that, in my mind they're quite pricey and still a beta product. I would wait a few years or build your own unless you don't mind the cost.\n* Install many more PIR sensors than you think you need, so you capture any movement in the room, and set a long timeout so lights never shut off prematurely (e.g.: \\~15 mins for restrooms, 1-2 hours for your living room, etc.)\n* DIY: Add sensors that don't require LoS (line of sight) to the detector, like the cheap radar sensors you can buy today (e.g.: RCWL-0516 which is $0.5). These have some issues with false-positives and are totally DIY, but they have great potential when used with classic PIR sensors to keep the lights on (they react to very small movements like magic, but require more power than PIRs so can't be battery powered).\n* DIY: Count people entering and leaving using 2 PIR in a quadrature layout (arguably one of the very best solutions to presence, but I'm not aware of any commercial solution on the market).\n* DIY: BLE presence detection via tracking phones or BLE tags - seems really cool, but I think it's not reliable enough to be used for real-time detection.\n* Explicit detection hacks:\n   * In a restroom: attach a simple door sensor to the lid of your toilet, so your automation can tell when the seat is up and keep the lights on.\n   * In a bedroom: add strain guages (weight sensors) to the foot of your bed, so you can tell if there's no-one / a pet / a person / multiple people on the bed (possibly even say who is there if your weights differ enough)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

That's not the same as most folks homes. most people live in a home where buy you can smash one window, and open a door or window in about three seconds. And contrary to popular belief that can be done rather quietly. A few strips of duct tape, and a nice crack, and you're in.  You don't have to have a valid key to start my house and drive it away, you're already in.\n\nI debate this point because I find it laughable when folks go off on things like this in this sub. Listen, we aren't going to keep all the batteries out unless we install steel doors coming with vault like security, and either bulletproof glass, smash proof glass, or put bars up on our windows. \n\nSame debate comes up with folks who are scared of smart locks, oh my gosh, somebody might hack my lock and get into my house!  setting up your home security is a matter of deciding how much effort you want to put forth, and how much money you want to spend, vs. the security gained. \nMy point is that the vast, and I mean vast majority of Home break-ins are you there people who managed to get their hands on a physical key, or just break in the goddamn house.  And I'm going to venture forthe I guess that the number of homes that are simply broken into by physical entry is probably and then 90's (as a percent). \n\nif you want to spend a whole bunch of extra time and effort worried about the possibility of being hacked, you are more than likely better off doing things like checking your physical barriers, make sure you have good lighting outside, even a decent, monitored alarm system. \n\nThe odds of someone hacking an NFC chip in your hand and managing to use that the gate entry is extraordinary miniscule. \n\n",

                    "Couple of thoughts.  First, your ethernet runs are probably the #1 thing to worry about right now.  Also wiring for smart blinds if you may want them eventually - cheaper to do it at studs than at completion.  Most of the other smart products are really designed to go in existing houses - smart switches and outlets wire up the same as their modern dumb counterparts, doorbell camera will use a standard 12v doorbell transformer, etc.  Unfortunately a lot of consumer-level surveillance products are wifi only, so there's no way to hardwire - although some people still do use PoE to power them.  But if you go with something a bit more prosumer (like Ubiquiti's solutions), you'll find full ethernet options (trust me, sharing your wifi bandwidth with a bunch of always-streaming cameras sucks.)\n\nMy house was rewired 20 years ago with double runs of cat 5e, forward thinking, but I'm already thinking about what it will take to rewire it again eventually  The second run was just for telephony, but thank god it's there - I'm in the process of converting them to Ethernet terminations, for a Ubiquiti wifi network.\n\nSo, I would look at doing double runs of Cat 6 to not only each room, but also a ceiling box for wifi APs in whatever rooms you'll want them.  Ceiling wifi has less chance of being obstructed by furniture.\n\nSmart outlets are pricey as hell, if you're doing a whole home.  My house has like 70 duplex outlets.  We use a combination of smart bulbs and switches, and wemo wallwarts for devices we want to control, and it does the same thing much cheaper.\n\nPower consumption monitoring - something everyone's looking at these days.  I'd look at a smart circuit breaker like Leviton just announced, or something like Sense in the breaker. \n\nHave you considered battery backups, if you will need them?  PoE is a great way to get everything on one backup battery/generator, your APs, cameras, and other devices will draw from the powered switch.  But our power was out for an hour today - we discovered the new tankless gas water heater doesn't work without it.  So, we're looking at retrofitting a generator circuit throughout the house - water heater, refrigerator, network.  Maybe you've got better power.  We're blocks from a capitol city center, and it's a constant problem here.",

I, on the other hand, would hope to build something superior to Alexa-- allowing for more complex \"if this, then that\" logic in routines, for example. From what I understand, I'd need a Zigbee or Z-wave USB dongle for use with my Pi, so before I invest in that-- has anyone tried Alexa and then replaced it with a Pi hub and determined that it's more capable than Alexa? If so, can you point to me to a tutorial I can use to get started?",

            "Best Mesh WiFi option\nHi all, hope I can pick your brains as I am going around in circles trying to settle on a mesh wifi solution for our 3 storied house. I am edging toward Google Wifi for its simplicity, but please let me know your thoughts (I have also looked at Netgear Orbi). Any thing else to consider?\n\nI want to achieve a bit more seamlessness, because we have some patches with poor wifi, and moving from one AP to another is always troublesome. Plus, the printer and network storage drop off every now and then.\n\nCurrent setup is internet from our cable provider (Ziggo in Netherlands), into a cable modem / router (Compal CH7465LG-ZG) which is set up for wifi too. This plugs into an ethernet that has outlets in most rooms. Plugged into the router is the Hue bridge plus a WD MyBookLive. A couple of Nest products run over wifi. In one room  we attached an old TP-Link Touch P5 as an AP, and this is mainly for a PC used for work and gaming. Our main streaming is done via TV, which plugs into the ethernet.\n\nThanks!",

Now there are some devices that are genuinely better if you go with the internet first, local second approach - and that's a fair argument to make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStart with your network. If you like to tinker and do everything yourself, Ubiquiti is the best choice at this moment. Fairly priced products that are of great quality and are genuinely easy to use if you understand basic computers. If you don't like to tinker as much and just want an easier solution, ubiquiti amplifi and ubiquiti instant are both great products for the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen we choose the hub of your choice. I personally use smartthings (yeah, yeah), which is great for my needs. But this is the one place where all (most) of my products meet and work together. Smartthings (mostly) requires internet to work, but is overall inexpensive and works great from my two years of experience. I personally use a majority of z-wave devices for my apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you don't need ambient light changes, or color options, then I would go with smart switches. Z-Wave smart switches are $30-$50 and offer high quality hardware that works *locally only.* This is nice because you won't have a bunch of random devices that *need* internet to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCameras are another thing. Nest, Ring, and Arlo all have superior motion detection compared to the more traditional camera systems. If that portion is important, proceed. However, you can get hardwired cameras that work *locally* so you don't need to rely on internet or wifi for those important moments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I think if someone is going to own their house and is seriously looking at this space they need to start with an overall view of where they want to go. If you just want to do a few outlets and such, do whatever. If you want to eventually automate the whole house then you should start with a *local first, internet second*  approach to properly protect your investments.",

You can also store the camera footage on a local server drive or on their dedicated NVRs (I got the Cloud Key Gen 2 Plus which acts as the cloud key and the NVR). The best part is you don't have to pay Nest a shit ton of money monthly to have them store your video. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe APs (the AC Lite and LR pictured) are the WiFi antennas that can live on the ceilings and be powered by POE.

Even if you run your own solution and create an easily upgradable solution with docker, there'll be a point where you focus on something else, get a bit bored, forget, and the release will slip.\n* Part of a large ecosystem. This is the promise of the cloud and I find it mostly delivers. Devices and services inter-operate in the cloud and it's not managed by you. For example, if my \"weather\" provider changes their API, I don't care, the nest engineers take care of that and always show me the correct weather. \n* Data analysis. Your data is collected, aggregated and analyzed. This can be used to generate models and learn your habits and the intricacies of your home. For example, how much cool air remains in your ducts given a specific outside weather determines how long the fan should run after the cooling compressor has stopped. It can also be used for electric savings by partnering with a local energy provider\n* It just works. People tend to have a higher tolerance for new technologies being sometimes complicated or unreliable as it's the \"bleeding edge\". Turning lights on/off has been as simple as \"flicking a switch\" for over a century. The patience people outside our community have towards HA is minimal .\n\nNow we all hate to have an expensive brick of a device when a service shuts down. This is especially true for devices that are annoying to replace and might even require a professional. Some ideas I'd like to see in the future.\n\n* Local WiFi API for devices. I'm OK if it's not standardized at first but give me a way to query sensors and perform basic operations on the device. For Nest, that'd be polling the mechanic status, temperature sensors, and activating various functions. No presence detection, weather, smart fans cycles, or even advanced programming. This is something that could be implemented ASAP. Doesn't need to be HTTPS, doesn't need to have a complicated access key (Serial should be enough?). Simple enough so it can be reliable and accessible.\n* DIRECT integration with 3rd party. I'm OK if there are no data standards beyond encapsulation here as well. i.e: use JSON but don't define all the parameter names in an industry-wide agreement. This would let me buy a Nest and integrate it with any websites that share a common API to send and receive data. This is really great in two fashion:\n   * Let's ME choose which cloud provider I want and if I want to pay for it or not. Maybe I'm an advanced user who wants IFTTT. Maybe I just want things to work and make the device communicate DIRECTLY with Amazon (Not via backend-backend integration)\n   * Let's manufacturer not care about building, maintaining, and operating a cloud solution. I'm thinking Chamberlain is not thrilled at creating their own cloud/app/support for a garage opener with 2 states and 2 operations. I think a lot more devices would be \"smart\" if all they had to do is import a library and add a $5 chip that does the WiFi and communicates with the existing I2C chip. Think an ESP8266 with an open-source firmware that can be configured to read from I2C and write to the WiFi. Everything else (Setup, communication, authentication, etc) is automated on the ESP8266 chip and all the manufacturer has to do is solder it and create a .config file to map values. That's it.",

Though it's the wrong time of year, getting a smart plugs for holiday lights is another good project. Having them all on and off at the same time, is super satisfying. \n\nHUBS: Checkout SmartThings, Wink, Apple HomeKit, Amazon Echo/Alexa, Google Home.  SmartThings and Wink are good it you want to control the system through a phone app.  Amazon Echo is great for voice control, and it can work with Wink/SmartThings or serve as a hub - however their phone app sucks. That said, voice control is the killer app of home automation, and most of the new devices coming on the market are Echo/Alexa compatible.  It's as safe a bet as there is.\n\nDEVICES: Once you know what hub/tech you're going with, check that services site for compatible products. When possible, buy items that are Zwave compatible. Most hubs support Zwave, so even if you switch your controlling hub later, you shoulnd't have to replace all your devices. GE's newer plugs seem to be pretty solid, but you can get by with cheaper Chinese ones if you're just playing around.\n\nSPEAKERS AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT: Logitech Harmony Home Ultimate is pretty solid for home entertainment control.  They have a basic hub, and also play well with others (Wink, Echo, etc.).  This could be a way to automate your home entertainment without buying new equipment.  SONOS is my personal favorite for speakers, and some of their newer models have some limited Alexa capability built in. \n\nADD-ON SERVICES: There are some other services that can help tie together different echosystems.  IFTTT (linked above), Stringify and Yonomi are worth a look.  I think Stringify is the leader.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Now I have my kitchen, dining room, and living room lights automated (although only lightly, when we arrive or leave after dark, and when motion is first detected in the morning). \n\nYou could also create a script that checks if your door is locked, and notifies you if it isn't. You could call this script either with an automation that runs at a given time, or manually when you call it via Google assistant or a echo or what have you. \n\nTry to typically maintain hardware overrides for devices (e.g. Smart switches except for bulbs, or at least a remote nearby, except for when it really can be automated well [aforementioned exterior lights are smart bulbs because I really can automate them easily and basically never want to override their automations]). \n\nOne of Paulus' tenants is that home automation needs to be highly reliable (i.e. &gt;99%) in order to be useful. Otherwise you'll just find it frustrating and better off not automating. So take it slow. If you add device trackers (I use Owntracks) just set that up and observe how well it works for a few days/weeks before you start turning lights on and off based on them. Follow a similar approach for any other \"mission critical\" functionality like locks and lights. I now have a smart plug letting me know when my clothes washer is done. If that notification doesn't go off, whatever, but if the lights act weird I'm pissed. \n\nRegarding the waf/faf/saf (wife/fianc\u00e9 /spouse acceptance factor), I kind of resent that term (although you did not use it) because usually it actually just means that you need to implement a reasonably usable and useful design, instead of the kludges some people want to do. In terms of getting partner support, I think the two most important things are not irritating them with unreliable features, and just admitting to them that spending an hour/hours to perfectly automate some household task isn't actually a reasonable endeavor, but is a silly hobby that you enjoy that ends up having a nice result. :-)\n\nWent on a bit of a ramble there but hopefully you can glean something of value.

                    "Let me shed some light on this for you as to what's happening and why.  WARNING!  LONG POST!\n\nEach device needs its own IP address, but since these are scarce (for IPv4), we use something called NAT (Network Address Translation).  Basically, the \"router\" gets the one real IP address and everything behind it gets a private address that can't route to the Internet.  When a device with a private address makes a connection to the Internet, the router makes the connection itself and records the port numbers of the source and destination devices in a table.  From that point on, it translates the addresses on all the packets based on the port numbers used in the table.\n\nFor incoming connections, you must go into the router and set up what incoming ports should be forwarded to which machines.  So, if you want HTTP to come in, you set which internal machine should get all incoming requests for port 80 (http).  You can also set a \"DMZ\" address (De-Militarized Zone), basically a catch-all for all other requests not forwarded somewhere else.   If you don't set up port forwarding or a DMZ, then you get NO INCOMING CONNECTIONS!  That's right.  Hackers can't reach all the lights and switches or get into your network at all.  Only what you forward comes in and only to the device you forward to.\n\nSo ... how can Google Assistant, Alexa, IFTTT, and the like turn on your lights?  These services do all processing in the cloud.  Your phone and smart speakers and displays don't have a million protocols built-in to access every manufacturer's smart system.  These services have no idea if your IP address is dynamic and might change, and they can't make an incoming connection to your network anyway!  \n\nWhat happens is that your devices make an *outgoing* connection (supported by the NAT technology) to a 3rd party server and identifies themselves using your account information, then holds the connection open.  Google, Alexa, IFTTT, and whoever can then contact the 3rd party server (which has a nice fixed IP address), authenticate themselves using OAUTH to get permission to control the devices connected to your account, and can send commands through the 3rd party server back through the connections the devices made out through your router.   This is why some people don't like direct WiFi devices and prefer a hub since you have a limit in the router's connection table.  However, that limit is over 65 thousand connections!  You'll be good for awhile!\n\nYour security issues have nothing to do with your router, and VLANs and all that are going to net you absolutely nothing.  The vulnerability will be with the security of the 3rd party server and the possibility that the devices and apps might be leaking information out of your network to the 3rd party server.  Connections aren't coming in!  If you are worried that these devices are snooping your network and reporting back, don't use unencryoted protocols, and you can VPN if worried about the leakage of metadata, but ... stick the questionable stuff on the guest network if you are worried.  That normally prevents direct access between devices. In most cases you'll need to put your phone on the guest network to set up the devices, and maybe to use the branded app, but your Google/Alexa/IFTTT connections should work fine and if the app supports viewing/changing the devices from the Internet, then it will work as well!\n\nAlso, you CAN get rid of that broadlink app and control the device from a local server.  This basically cuts off access from outside the house, including all your Assistants.   What I've done for my own network is to use a dynamic DNS for incoming connections and then use IFTTT to glue various Google Assistant phrases to the \"Webhook\" module.   This requires a port forward for incoming connections from IFTTT to my server (a BeagleBone Black) which are done over SSL and use a password in the POST body.  I'll likely reflash my Sonoff devices to keep those local, but I don't know about my WiFi bulbs yet.   I'd need to investigate the protocols being used and see if I can control those locally.  I'm just not there with my software yet, but the IFTTT/Webhook bridge gives me fine-grained control over what comes in to the broadlink and prevents anything going out.\n",

But if worried, yeah.\n\nAs for the blackbean, I'm not sure what Hass.io allows since I run my own software, but see if Hass.IO allows incoming Webhook/REST control.  You then register with something like duckdns and forward incoming connections to whatever control your blackbean.   Pop over to IFTTT and set up an applet that says \"if this ...\" select Google Assistant and what phrase you want to say, \"then that ...\" select Webhooks and put in your duckdns address and whatever URL parameters it needs.   This means that Google Assistant will talk to IFTTT as your 3rd party server, and the IFTTT applets filter the triggers you want onto your network.\n\nThere are other ways of integrating with Google Assistant, but IFTTT is pretty easy to set up.  The only drawback is you give up natural language processing.  You get 3 variants of your trigger phrase.  With the backend I use (custom - https://github.com/uudruid74/RestHome), I can say \"Hey Google, start the movie\" and it plays a macro that switches the input, sets the sound processing mode on the AV, turns down the lights and hits \"play\" on the bluray all using a single IFTTT applet, but I do end up needing a LOT of these!",

            "Best way to integrate 3 Echo Dot's with Whole House Audio?\nWe are about to start a home addition project and will be re-drywalling our entire downstairs ceiling. I figured this was the time to add a meaningful whole house audio system with in-ceiling speakers. Our family are big Echo Alexa users for smart home items and to play Apple Music and also use Apple Airplay via Apple TV. We would like to have those connected in a logical way. I'd love any advice or thoughts on the best way to accomplish this scenario:\n\n**Basic Layout:**\n\n* Front porch: 2 in-ceiling outdoor speakers + wall control switch\n* Dining room: 2 in-ceiling speakers  +  Echo dot + wall control switch\n* Kitchen: 2 in-ceiling speakers +  Echo dot + wall control switch\n* Living Room: 2 in-ceiling speakers for the TV and a subwoofer hidden in the wall. +  Echo dot + wall control switch\n* Back Porch: 2 in-ceiling outdoor speakers  + wall control switch\n\n**Desired Use Cases:**\n\n* I'd like a direct input from each room that has an Echo Dot into the main system to use its built-in mic. The entire whole house audio system would always be default on to the Alexa channel. So if I'm in a room with Alexa, I say 'play xyz song' or 'turn on lights' and I'd hear the response throughout the whole house system that was currently switched on.\n* It would be slightly inconvenient I think to have each Echo channel go to the whole system, but the living room/dining room/kitchen are all very open so not a big deal to me. And the two outdoor speaker sets could always have the volume knob off by default.\n* I'd also like to be able to swap the whole house system input from the Alexa channel to the Apple TV/Airplay channel (ideally via the Harmony app or even better, by a button on the wall control switch). That way for example, I could be outside on the porch, flip the speaker to the Airplay channel and airplay a song from my phone (instead of having an Alexa outside as the input.). Basically the 3 Echo's would be 'split' into one A channel ideally, and my B channel would be the Apple TV. \n* We also have satellite Echo Plus speakers we'd put in a room or two upstairs. (I don't want to wire in-ceiling speakers  there) that way, if we really wanted the music to 'sync' we could use the multi-room Alexa feature for that one-off speaker.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* What kind of home audio amp/controller/switch should we use? Should we have 3/8\" jack input/USB power plates added to each room to plug the Alexa into? Is there a better way?\n* What do y'all think of having the Alexa's always on (privacy concerns aside) and plugged into the main speakers downstairs that is always on? Is there a better way? I am okay controlled the audio each room with a switch, but if there was an app-based way I'd prefer that.\n* Has anyone seen a writeup on have personal experience with this? I've done a lot of searching with no luck so far. I see a lot of detail on the Google Chromecast audio option but we'd prefer to stay with the Amazon eco-system if possible.\n\nThanks in advance for any wisdom here.",

I use Niles speaker switches to select and split signal to each speaker pair. I have 6 echo dots two of which feed the receivers using audio cables. I can tell any echo to play whatever but have to name which receiver if I'm not speaking to the wired dot/receiver pair. Like Alexa play xyz on bedroom. Or Alexa play abc in living room. I created a group to play same thing everywhere. Volume is controlled by Alexa app but that works across all connected rooms. I do have wall controls for volume in each room. Not sure if there is a more \"automated\" way. I've heard Sonos has some sort of controller to automate some of this but haven't looked into it. ",

            "A proposal for an open source security camera system that leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nI hate the motion detection (background subtraction) algorithms that are used in security camera systems. They are difficult to tune, trigger on my dogs walking around the house, trigger false positives when lighting changes, and were invented in the 80's. I want an open source security system that can leverage modern machine learning and deep learning to detect cars, people, dogs, or any object for which I have annotated data to train! \n\nI have installed and tested several open source camera systems (Zoneminder, Kerberos.io, Shinobi, Motion), but they are either difficult to setup, don't address privacy concerns, consume way too many resources, use weird open source licenses (free/pro versions), or don't have a plugin architecture that supports developers contributing new vision algorithms. For an in-depth review of these projects see Jason Antman's blog post ([https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation/](https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation/)).\n\nMy initial goal is develop a software architecture that allows for the processing and monitoring of multiple cameras with modern computer vision algorithms with the assumption that these algorithms will advance over time. The architecture should support local processing on small embedded systems (Raspberry PI, laptops, etc.) or private cloud processing. Currently, systems like the Raspberry PI may not be able to use deep neural network models, but companies like NVIDIA, Intel, and Amazon are trying to develop small USB sticks that can efficiently run deep learned models. This architecture should not just be limited to monocular camera systems; why not make use of RGB-D sensors (e.g., Microsoft Kinect) or stereo-vision systems? I will also create an API that allows other home automation systems (e.g., Home Assistant, IFTTT, etc.) to use this new vision system.\n\nI am a roboticist at a major research university and I have a lot of experience with computer vision, robot motion planning, and reinforcement learning, so I understand the technical issues that need to be addressed. Everything that I write will be licensed under GPLv3 and won't limit any features based on any \"pro\" versions. However, I may be able to financially support this project by packaging and selling embedded cameras and single-board computers (Raspberry PI). I fully expect many DIYers to download the software and run it for free on their own systems, but I expect many people will want to just purchase a working system in order to save time. \n\nI became a roboticist because I wanted to bring helpful and safe robots into my own home, so this project may just be the first step towards enabling home robots by providing situational awareness through vision systems.\n\nI'm going to leverage many common open source projects for the algorithmic heavy lifting: OpenCV 4, TensorFlow, and ROS. I'm fairly new to modern UI design (haven't written PHP or Javascript since 2004), but it looks like React / Native is a fairly cross-platform architecture for web and phone app design.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

                    "Hi [u/AtlantaBanana](https://www.reddit.com/user/AtlantaBanana),\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're working on somewhat similar projects. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the last year, my company has been working on [Cirrus](https://www.security-camera-warehouse.com/security-camera-software/cirrus-cms), which is now in Alpha: Milestone 1. Milestone 1 is mostly just live viewing / viewing of recorded footage of ONVIF or RTSP video streams and Hikvision and Uniview manufacturer's cameras APIs calls for camera names and controls. (Axis and Dahua has also contributed their APIs recently, but we have not yet implemented them -- Axis does a better job than most with ONVIF compliance, so their API may not be necessary). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike you, I used all of the current open projects before deciding that we were going to make our own. They generally use an absurd amount of resources because most of them are just using Electron (or similar) to launch a web-browser with custom code into an executable file. This makes it so that they can run in a desktop environment, but nowhere else. This is also why they struggle so much on framerates. A web-browser is a quick way to launch this sort of app, but not a tremendously efficient one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe took a different route. Our lead developer programmed the single-use surveillance system used by Norad for monitoring the US nuclear silos. He decided to use C++ and QT code so that we could write a singular codebase and then be able to compile and effectively run on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and Linux ARM based embedded devices. Embedded QT is also stripped down enough to run in the resource starved environment that is most NVRs at 4K 30 FPS. Ambrella and Hisilicon do a fantastic job at H.264/5 hardware encoding, but don't leave a lot of resources on the table for analytics or decoding (playing video). Our iOS version should launch soon (we solved a major technical hurdle this week) and is wrapped in React. Android will be coming, but has the same QT to React hurdle for displaying video for us to solve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe just hired a machine learning specialist this week to begin work on Milestone 2, which is cloud storage, analysis via TensorFlow and OpenCV, and evidence / incidence reporting. We're currently evaluating Intel Movidius chips / sticks as part of the stack. We're currently looking for a Director of Cloud Engineering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe also have just received toolchains from 2 major manufacturers for putting our application onto their POE NVRs. Our goal for the NVRs is to take the Cirrus App and turn in into an OS and make a camera-manufacturer-neutral NVR (currently ONVIF cross-manufacturer compatibility only works when the camera is on the network).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe currently a retailer, so we will continue to sell products, but we will be adding some diversity to our company when Cirrus is totally done. Our business model is anything that can be run on the client's recorder or camera is free; anything that takes up server resources or distributed computing would eventually have a cost.   \n\n\nWe plan on open sourcing the vast majority of this project, eventually. We, originally, wanted to go that route 100%, but have been forced not to do so because of several factors:\n\n(1) the NVR functionality can't be open sourced completely, as it needs to include a bunch of closed source code, such as H.264 / H.265 encoding/decoding and manufacturer API support, as we want to have the software play nice with devices without our code.\n\n(2) the camera firmware is where we see the most ability to create open source code. Our idea is to give it away to any manufacturer who wants to use it. \n\n(3) open source has a lot of advantages, but there's some dangers as well. The open source ONVIF Device Manager discovery tool scandal showed what can go wrong with open sourcing surveillance software (the tool had malicious code in it that no one caught for a long time)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It's a constant 35-40mbit/s stream. You have to grab that stream, decode it into a format you can work with, and then analyze it all real time. I only have 8 cameras, and I could change to 4K or 8K cameras, which would increase that stream size significantly (and my storage requirements, and I already have 8TB dedicated to my cameras).\n\nI don't use any image based detection, I use PIR sensors inside and outside. I think what would be a better option is more hardware options with PIR/microwave motion detection. There are good options out there but they are not easy to implement. My indoor sensors are z-wave and go through a hub and then make an HTTP call to my Blue Iris server. My outdoor sensors are low frequency RF that go back to a base station that triggers a z-wave sensor via dry contact that then triggers my hub to make an HTTP call to Blue Iris.

You'll need to open a port on your NAT router, and may want/need to install an SSL/TLS certificate (as I believe it's web service based) to encrypt the details, but once setup the app should be able to directly \"phone home\" to control things remotely.\n\nHTH!",

My sister had a Roomba at the time and it just seemed so random and never cleaned every area. 2) if it needs to charge, it will resume back to the location it stopped once charged. The Roomba would just start all over again from the beginning, again with a random pattern. 3) the Neato has a flat front where the vacuum is allowing it to get corners better.

I could never tell when the rinsing fluid was low or out. \n\n2. I have hard water so I need a built in water softener (until I get around to getting a whole home one).\n\n3. Modern dishwashers are all pretty silent. Like 42dB silent, which is the noise level of a library. since I never know when the dishwasher is running; even when I'm right in front of it, I don't know when it's done because all applicance makers have decided to use the exact same beep. Unloading the dishwasher is my wife's job so she likes to claim she didn't know it was run or that it's done. \n\nThe Bosch SHEM78WH5N solved all of those problems and more. \n\nIt tells you when rinse fluid is low and can order more from Amazon (although I use subscribe and save so I won't be using this),  it has a water softener and monitors the amount of salt you have and can order more, connects to IFTTT for notifications, it keep track of how many dishwashing tabs you have left and can order more or notify you. \n\nSetup was easy. The app is decent, although with voice control through Google home/assistant via IFTTT I don't think I will be using it much. The most surprising thing to me was how privacy and security focused it was (besides it recommending WPS which is insecure). User tracking is off by default. The app has a setting to disconnect the dishwasher from their servers and only have it accessible on the LAN. It also has an API (which I think can be local) and a free developer program. \n\nOh, and it's a great dishwasher. Like the best consumer dishwasher you can get. \n\nNow for the downsides.\n\nIt doesn't hold more than 1 cleaning tablet. Not a big deal if you can remember to put one in when you are unloading it. It's just a habit you and your family have to get into. \n\nThe API is free to use but not opensource. \n\nNo direct google home/assistant support. You will need IFTTT or Home assistant. Alexa is supported. \n\nThe biggest one is the price. It's like $1,300 installed and delivered. But I accidentally found a loophole in BestBuys pricing. BestBuy lists the lower model Bosch 800s as being app controlled which is wrong. I had the other one sent and installed but couldn't find how to connect to it because it didn't exist. Called BestBuy to confirm and they refunded the first model and with a little bit of a sob story and frustration (I never was rude to the rep) they offered me the dishwasher I have now for $900. As of this post they have only corrected this issue on the listing of one Bosch 800 series model.  If it says app controlled and it's not model SHEM78WH5N, it's wrong.",

I understand that basically there is no true privacy here. I\u2019m looking at the Nest route, but I was also considering attaching the camera to a smart plug so it really did turn off at the wall when I came home. I only want to monitor the cat while we\u2019re out, so when we\u2019re in, it will have no function. I feel a little weird about it promising to have turned off when it senses me coming home. \n\nAm I being over paranoid here? What do the rest of you do? I\u2019m not particularly interested in setting up a dedicated local network camera, as I don\u2019t have time for the project. So it will have to be a cloud solution. \n\n- Temperature control\n\nI don\u2019t want pretty kitty getting too hot. We live in essentially a greenhouse in the summer. I have a built in AC unit that comes with its own app (IntesisHome). It\u2019s google home/ IFTTT enabled however the thermostats are way off. I want to be able monitor the temperatures reliably and trigger the AC accordingly. The google nest looks way too expensive for just a thermometer. I want to keep it working with the google family ideally, as I use my google assistant all the time. I would love a bit more automation out of the AC.\n\nLastly, pet feeders.\n\nIs there anything I can automate here? I have seen some very basic timed feeders, but I wondered if there was something a little more reputable in our community? \n\nThanks for the help team, sorry to be yet another recommendations post but this is a very specific territory I\u2019ve not had to think about before!\n\n(Smartthings, google assistant, android, Harmony and Hue)",

I would personally recommend getting a puzzle feeder too (even if you don\u2019t go the auto feeder route, I consider a puzzle feeder a necessity). Catit have a tower, digging cups, and some other varieties depending on what takes your kitty\u2019s fancy. There\u2019s also the Kong toy option. You can get auto feeders for wet food too, they\u2019re usually about 4 portions, but I think feeding the wet yourself is better for relationship building and you won\u2019t have to clean a device regularly either.\n\nMy advice: Have the auto feeder go off in the morning so kitty doesn\u2019t disturb your sleep with begging, and then at night throw some food in the puzzle feeder to hone their problem solving and hunting skills. Biscuits/kibble, however, shouldn\u2019t be making up the majority of kitty\u2019s diet, wet or raw appropriate for kittens is the go there.

With a new cat I needed something more basic, so I have their 6-slot timed feeder and manually fill it every morning. However I would have loved to upgrade to the their properly Smart, app-enabled automatic feeder when I had the chance, I could just never justify it. \n\nI recommend as the other poster said, have the feeder go off earlier than you get up (somewhere in 4-6am is good) so kitty is fed early and doesn't wake you up screaming. I'd recommend having it just dispense small amounts through the day and night, that way kitty never has long periods of \"OMG I'M STARVING!!!!\" and the destruction that results from that. In order to still be associated with food, I do a small amount of canned food once per day, plus treats, that way I still get the bonding time but without the constant nagging. \n\nAlso, the Catit toys are fantastically awesome, if your kitty plays with toys the track that has a light-up ball is hugely popular. \n\nFor a litter box, I had the ScoopFree and once I added some customizations (stand and re-usable tray from LitterWorks, litter from PetSmart, plastic tub with trash bag for waste disposal) it was fantastic. Unfortunately it was eventually rejected when my biggest kitty got sick and decided she didn't want to climb into it any more, now I'm back to basic (GIANT) covered corner boxes that get manually scooped.

They're on the home network, and whether it's a REST API to their IP address or an SSH connection to a tiny Linux machine, I have direct and private control of my hardware.\n\nI'd like to keep my equipment over ethernet cables or the wifi, and I don't like signing up with services or going to an external website just to send commands to a device that's on the same WLAN as me. I don't like the idea of contributing to a corporate database of every home interaction. Between the inherent privacy and things still working while the internet is down, I will be keeping my house dumb until I can get equipment that I can trust and rely on.\n\nI'd like to swap out some bulbs and eventually some switches with some smart equipment, but I'm having a hard time finding advertised features that match my level of paranoia.

            "I was robbed. Thanks Wink.\nI trusted Wink. That trust bit me in the ass early this week. \n\nI woke up to my dog growling at about 2am a couple nights ago. She never growls so I grabbed my very real looking pellet handgun and went downstairs. My front door was wide open and a couple boxes of electronics were gone (I am renovating my basement and stored my equipment near the door to get it out of the way).\n\nI went outside and saw the two girls and one guy running down the street with the boxes. I told them to get on the ground or I would shoot. They complied. \n\nI had them pinned down at \u201cgun\u201d point until police arrived. While waiting for the police I asked them how they got in my house, and they explained that the door was unlocked. They said they had checked the neighbourhood a couple of nights earlier to see who didn\u2019t lock their doors. \n\nI was shocked because I had been using Wink to lock my doors for a few years now. I updated to the latest version a few weeks ago and about a week after updating my robot to lock the door stopped working. My pregnant wife was home alone for half of those nights when the door was left unlocked. \n\nWe don\u2019t live in a bad place, but it\u2019s a new neighbourhood still under construction and according to the police the contractors know people\u2019s schedules and use that to rob them. \n\nAnyways we got lucky and never lost anything and no one was hurt. Now we are manually locking our door each night and have already added security cameras and motion sensing lights. \n\nNow my question is this: \n\nWhat do I do about home automation? \n\nI have seen several recommendations for Wink replacements but which is best? I understand that I should find something that supports the equipment I have, but what else should I look for?",

If they choose to use GSuite, [Google gives them multiple options on how and where their data is stored, including hosting in multiple regions and defining an organizational structure for redundancy.](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7630496?hl=en) \n\nNow, perhaps that's a little too pedantic and you actually mean that customers can't choose where the service processes themselves, including backend/networking/support services that are used by GSuite products, are hosted. If that's the case, then I'd just point out that nobody is forcing them to use Gsuite or any Google products. The \"control\" is in choosing to do your business with a single company (point of failure). If your access to whatever Gsuite provides you is **critical**, then you need to design a better solution to handle your business needs. Typically, though, the downtime that Google experiences is small enough that most are willing to take the risks of relying on Google. \n\n&gt;And a super sensitive downvote too. Sheesh.

I feel like you completely misinterpreted my post.\n\n&gt; You need an infrastructure to run all the equipment. Are you aware that ISP\u2019s now have limits on the service? 500Gb a month is common, I know plenty of people running 3 WiFi cameras and a door bell, and go over their limit. In fact they need to reduce the motion /recording schedules to conserve on bandwidth which compromises security. In addition they have Netflix watching movies. I have 1TB ISP limit and have no cable TV, we use over the air TV and have YouTube, Netflix, amazon etc.. multiple iOS devices, network printers, and no cloud recording devices and use over half per month. An NVR video recording system which Is accessible remotely and runs on your network (LAN)via PoE, stores unlimited data, most default setups have 2TB storage.\n\nYeah. Which is why I said I'm not interested if they are using cloud storage or if the system doesn't integrate with anything else. With Blue Iris I can trigger things via MQTT, API calls, etc.\n\n&gt; In order to have a smart home you need adequate WiFi coverage, for those devices. Certainly if you have a multi-story home. 2-3 AP devices in a large house is not uncommon, what do you need to run that? A wired connection to plug the AP in, where would that be? You\u2019d pre-wire it in the ceiling, where would the wire terminate? In your media closet with a nice L2 64 port switch and a nice rack mounted router.\n\nMy whole post was talking about avoiding WiFi products. But I do have multiple Ubiquiti APs wired up in my ceiling already.\n\n&gt; Look I\u2019m not talking about a cheapy set up with consumer off the shelf equipment and a title Lynksys router... and plug in wireless extenders... I\u2019m talking rack mounted managed devices, firewalls, and servers running your home. Anyone can go buy a Costco wireless camera and tape it to the side of the house. I\u2019m talking professionally installed camera in the eve of the roof up high where it can\u2019t be slapped down and Btw, wired and never have to worry about bandwidth consumption or battery\u2019s.\n\nYeah. That is what my existing one is. But unless it is using an NVR that can integrate with the rest of my HA stuff then that's gonna be a no from me dog.\n\n&gt; I don\u2019t understand your comment about running blue tooth and zwave, those don\u2019t connect. I never said anything about that. \n\nThen I suggest reading it.\n\n\"or if they use Bluetooth door locks **instead** of Z-Wave... then I'm super **not** interested.\"",

I installed dozens of home automation systems before anyone had even heard of \"the cloud\".  I'm currently a senior software developer for a global Fortune 500 corporation.  I currently own 3 homes, and have bought and sold 2 others.  My primary residence has, by my last count, 55 smart home devices which include motions sensors, door contacts, vacuums, cameras, wall mounted tablets, flood sensors, water shutoffs, landscape lighting, plugs, switches, bulbs, bias lighting, cabinet light.... you name it.   Along with those I probably have another 50 or so virtual devices to trigger and monitor various other functions in my home. I've had smart home tech in this home since I built it 11 years ago,  as well as in my previous home (though not nearly to the extent).  My secondary residence has another dozen or so devices.  I've written my own smart apps from scratch.  I'm a mod for the Google Home sub, which I have been since before the original Google Home was released.  I've been interviewed by Google reps during focus groups regarding home automation.  I've got the #2 top post of all time in this sub.  Hahaha!!!! I'll stop now.",

Would setting up a smart house/home automation with primarily that purpose be overdoing it?\nBy \"primarily\" I mean I'd mostly use home automation for the purpose of keeping my house safe. \n\nI've been lurking in this sub for a while now. I've found some great tips that'd make life more convenient, like [smart shower heater](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/aojm1b/best_smart_home_functions/), temp control, [smart lights for better wake up routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/9mpwsc/what_are_the_best_home_automation_routines_you/), and so on.\n\nBut that's not as important as protecting my home from burglars. I just recently moved out and I've heard not so good stories in the neighborhood. Here we don't have basic home alarm too.\n\nMy plan with smart home as right now is:\n\n* Security cameras/CCTV that would alert me as soon as possible. This is the most important part. Mainly to my phone, as I'm often not at home, but it'd be nice if it can ring the house's alarm too so the would be burglars know something's off.\n\n* Sensors. Door sensors, motion sensors, glass break sensors. Same, notification to my phone and preferably alarm.\n\n* Smart doorbell... I guess? I'm still not sure, I mean I just want to know who's on the front door and communicate with the guest (or the potential burglar lol). I want to do this even when I'm not at home, in case there's a potential burglar checking out if the house is empty.

                    "There are a lot of overlap between smart house automation and home security; monitoring doors and windows, alerting you to problems, etc. And because of that, there are a few systems that are specifically intended to be both home automation and home security.\n\nI have a few suggestions:\n\n1. Go with an automation system with built-in security. Of all the options, this is the simplest. However, it will also be either the most expensive (high monthly cost), or the least reliable (uses systems not truly meant for security). I can't speak for all of them, but the ones that I've look into are very, *very* expensive. Vivint, for instance, is $75/month. \"Nothing is too large a price to pay for peace of mind,\" my eye. This option is likely going to be a painfully limiting one, too; automation will be harder, apps more difficult to use, and a fairly small number of technologies it will work with - Vivint does Z-Wave, but won't talk with Hue, for instance.\n\n2. Set up smart devices to monitor doors, windows, fire, whatever. Then have whatever system you set up manipulate a single relay connected to a cheap, dumb, off-the-shelf, $10/mo monitored alarm service. The smart house portion does its smart house thing, and when it detects a problem, the smart house half takes care of notifying you, leaving the security part to only do the phone-the-police bit. It's not going to be smart - if you have a fire alarm as part of your smart house, for instance, it'll hook up to the same alarm, but at least you'll have monitored service. This is likely the cheapest option, but it'll be a little tricky to set up, and won't be quite as reliable as other options.\n\n3. Use dual-purpose wired circuits. Run wired sensors for doors, windows, CO sensors, and fire alarms, etc. Get a monitored, fully-wired system, then hook the sensors up to both the wired system and your smart house system. You'll be able to monitor the house through the security system, and still use the sensors to run your smart house, too.\n\n4. Finally: Use two systems. If there isn't a lot of overlap (say, you only want smart sensors on the front and back doors), just get two sensors for those doors, one for the smart house, one for the security system. Get a cheap, reliable, off-the-shelf security system, and let it do its thing, separate from the smart house. This is the simplest option, and likely the cheapest option, as long as there isn't a lot of overlap.\n\nAs for sensors, cameras should be manually accessed. Even really good cameras get a lot of false alarms, and there's nothing that annoys your neighbors more than constantly blaring alarms. It only takes a few before they are desensitized to them. Instead, get cameras you can access remotely, but have your security system ping you to check them. Use the security sensors - doors and windows, glass break, motion, etc. - to set off an alarm, not the cameras. Unless you're willing to go fully DIY and get your hands dirty, the cameras should be their own separate thing, not really connected to anything else.\n\nDoor and window sensors are the most important, and generally cheapest, then fire/smoke/CO detection, then glass break and motion sensors, then water leak and other specialty sensors.",

On the server itself there'd be a flow running to receive the heartbeat and if it fails to get a \"sensor good\" message for a set time the flow would run a \\[$ sudo shutdown +1 \"unauthorized access\"\\], if it gets a good key it would execute a \\[sudo shutdown -c\\] and perhaps if a bad key were sent too many times even do something exciting like trip a relay inside that shorts the power button to do a hard shutdown (I'd avoid power manipulation external to the box; it's not easy but is entirely possible to do ATS shenanigans with a separate power supply if you're worried about three letter ninjas going after your shit.)  \n\n\nThis is, of course, an thought exercise.",

You have a lot of great commentary but I may not have explained clearly my preference is to link all to a common hub, and Alexa just becomes one of several input mechanism options to control everything.   \n\n&gt; You absolutely are going to have to deal with additional apps for different plugs and devices, even if you plan to use only Alexa. One new different app for every new brand of device you add, even if it's just \"Wi-Fi, works with Alexa\".\n\nSo I have zwave/zigbee devices which have their own apps, but I've linked them directly to Wink... and have never used the specific apps.  Someone else mentioned a Wifi switch that works with wink (iHome?) and I suspect that links directly to WInk.\n\n&gt; Given you already have a Z-Wave hub and Z-Wave devices, if a repeater device gets your signal out there, why not stay with Z-Wave. Most hubs including SmartThings do expose function to Alexa, so you still could be using Alexa as your primary control. But benefit from the lower power use (for the devices' radios and electronics) of Z-Wave and less-crowded radio band than 2.4GHz WiFi and which has better building penetration due to lower frequency.\n\nI am building out my system based on the product... in one scenario the GE zwave light switches were my best option, but I also use the Sylvannia RGB flex strips (awesome on my 20ft patio to light it up in color) and that is zigbee.   And...  in looking for an outdoor plug for the yard I may have to go wifi!\n\n&gt; Mixed-vendor multiple apps are unfortunately a fact of life if you want everything controlled through Alexa. \n\nI'm not ready to give in to that...  the promise of Wink as one devices connecting to all is technically there, they just dont update the software to support the newer connected devices.  There are other products out there attempting similar. Another low cost option supports zwave and zigbee... but not wifi.\n\nI'm still researching.  But this thread started with my quest for better long range back yard switching... and I have some more experiments to do this weekend with zwave before making big decisions.\n\nthanks again and good luck with your project",

Or if ST ever gets sold/goes out of business.  \nUnlikely?  Sure.  But then a year or two ago everyone thought the same about Wink.\n\nBut as far as everything else, you need to go with what works for YOUR home and YOUR level of involvement and no one else's.  Every home/user is different as is every solution.  If you want a plug and play installation with an easy to use interface and little personal involvement in managing it, then ST is the right solution for you.  If you outgrow it, then HA may be an option, especially if you want to do more things or use diverse platforms that aren't supported by ST. \n\nTL;DR - No one needs to convince you that one solution or another is better for YOU.

I can use just about any platform out there and find a way to integrate it into HA.  Once it's in there, I can interact with it and use the data to automate things.  It's the difference between having a universal remote and having a truly smart home - I don't have to react, my home is proactive.\n\nI have the following platforms, all connected and interactive within HA:\n\n* Wink - Zigbee and Schlage\n* Zwave\n* Hue\n* Google Home Hub/Minis\n* Alexa Show, Dots and Classic V1 \n* 2 Harmony Hubs\n* Ring\n* Wyze, Foscam and one Chinese no brand cam\n* Multisensors I built myself with ESPHome\n* An LED Strip controller I built with ESPHome\n* Automatic Pro in my car\n* My AcuRite 5 in 1 Weather Station\n* My Bloomsky Sky1 Weather Station\n* ecobee thermostat\n* Deluge torrent client\n* OctoPrint server for my 3D printer\n* Waze\n* Google Calendar\n* Allergy and Air Quality data\n* Local traffic/accident reports\n* Weather Radar/Lightning Data\n* Info on SpaceX and other rocket launches\n...and at least a dozen other platforms.\n\nAll of these things interact with each other and can trigger things or report on things or announce themselves. They work with each other so I don't have to. If I leave one of the doors open or unlocked, I get a notification before I am more than 2-3 blocks away.  If I am running low on gas, the house tells me before I am scheduled to go somewhere.  If it starts to rain, the house tells me that I have windows open.  If I have an appointment and the traffic gets bad, the house tells me to leave earlier.  \n\nThings like that are possible with HA that aren't either possible or easy with other platforms. I came into it knowing nothing about Linux, Zwave, etc.  I had never seen a Pi close up.  Now I have it running on a VM server and I've learned enough to be helping others and moderating forums and subreddits.\n\nBut I like learning new things and I have the time to put into it.  Not everyone does.  HA is easier than ever (I started in 2016 when it wasn't as friendly a UI or easy to install/configure.) but like anything there is a learning curve.  You can go as deep or as shallow as you want with HA nowadays, but I feel like it's worth it for the things I am able to do with it.  And the other major factor for me is the community of users and devs themselves.  I really enjoy every minute I am part of it.\n\nHopefully this helps to fill in some of the blanks for you.",

            "Newbie here! Looking for some direction!\nI'm looking at what you guys will probably all consider a basic setup - but want to make sure I go about this the right way.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to setup some outside lights to turn on at certain times, and I also like the idea of the hue with being able to change colors and dim.\n\nI have two driveway light poles, and then some exterior home lights I would like to do first.  \n\nMy thoughts, if possible, would be to have both light poles turn on at dusk - but the furthest one by the road turn off at say 9pm, and the one by the house dim substantially at that time.  The lights attached to the house and garage would do something similar - turn into some dim night / security lights at night.  \n\nI'm thinking of going the bulb route on these so I can always leave the switch on.  I know it was a pain in the hind-end to replace all my switches as I have a goofy wiring setup.  I also wouldn't mind changing the colors on them - red and green this time of year for example.  The local football team colors on game nights could be fun too.  Eventually though, I have some spot lights on my shed that face towards my house - I wouldn't mind being able to turn those on with my phone too - either the bulb or via the switch somehow when I let the dogs out for some additional yard lighting.  We have coyotes in the area, so pet safety is a concern at night too.\n\nI was looking at the Phillips Hue starter pack for now - but I didn't know if this was the best route?  I also do have NEST Cameras and smoke detectors, so if there's a better route to go, I'd be interested in ideas too.",

            "Smart home alarm system - Kit vs DIY?\nHey all, \n\nSo I'm looking to implement some form of security system. The aim is to secure a house with an alarm system which can be accessed and controlled from an app. It must be able to send realtime notifications should a sensor be triggered.\n\nNow, I've been looking around and im at a point where I'm not sure which is the best direction to head in, so I'm looking for opinions of what people would do.\n\nI'm based in the UK, please tell me suggestions for things I can get ahold of here.\n\nI've been obviously looking at a smart home setup, with sensors, a hub, and an app to control. We already have a separate camera system installed around the property.\n\nThis is where it gets iffy for me, and where inexperience becomes a problem.\n\nI'm not sure whether to go for a pre-built kit, or if I should go for a DIY solution.\n\nFor pre built kits, I'm pretty much down to two very similar systems\n[One](Yale Sync Smart Home Alarm (Works with Amazon Alexa) https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FR78X16/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_MU-kCb5XC2E6R)\nAnd [two](Yale Smart Home Alarm Kit https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01I549JFO/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_JV-kCb3ZJEZ9E)\n\n\nFor a DIY solution, I was looking at a HomeAssistant (or alternative) method on a raspberry pie, zwave adapter and sensors. \n\nMy issue with this solution is that I'm not sure what sensors to go for. I'm a compsci guy so getting down and technical isn't an issue. Also, Im struggling to find an app which will allow for realtime notifications. (IE if a door is opened, it pings my phone saying so)\n\nCurrently, there is very few \"smart appliances\" in the house. But I'm heading in that direction for this project.\n\nAnd that's where I'm at. I'm wondering what people would do in this situation and which would be best. I'll put some points below to summarize what it ought to be/have:\n\n- smart home alarm system\n\n- door sensors, window/glass break sensors, motion sensors, PIR camera (maybe)\n\n- certain sensors should be set to trip the alarm immediately, whilst others should have an entrance/exit delay. (Though I gather this is a fairly normal feature to have)\n\n- lightswitches/plugs which can be turned on/off remotely/independently, and also can be set to turn on should an alarm be triggered.\n\n- a wireless keypad/maybe rfid fobs which can be used to arm/disarm/part-arm the system. (So it needs to work both locally without an app, as well as with an app for control)\n\n- realtime notifications to Android devices on events like motion triggers, glass break, and arm/disarms (We're solely Android here)\n\n- the ability to isolate sensors/exclude a sensor from the alarm forest. IE removing a sensor from the system temporarily so that it does not trigger an alarm. \n\n- the system does NOT need to be monitored by a company - we'll handle that. Just needs to be accessible remotely (different user accounts as well, so we know who is doing what)\n\n\nI realize this is a long one, and any suggestions are welcome. I'm new to the home security field, so if ive missed anything please do say and I'll add more info where necessary. Also, written on mobile so I apologize in advance for any formatting issues. I'm going to try to fix them now! \n\nThanks everyone :)\n",

You could buy a generic Z-Wave or Zigbee thermostat, a temp sensor for every major room of the house, and an automation controller (like SmartThings, Hubitat, Home Assistant, etc.), and still have money left over.\n\nFor security cameras, that is very much the route I'd go. I have no brand recommendations, but steer clear of all the major brands. Sounds counter-intuitive, like I'm suggesting you cheap out on security, but buy security as three separate pieces - the cameras, the storage (an NVR), and cloud storage. Nest (Arlo, Amazon, etc.) make their money by getting you trapped in their ecosystem. That's fine for a thermostat. Maybe even a doorbell. Not security.",

Right now, I have SmartThings wifi in my apartment, mainly just used for the wifi capability at the moment.  Plan to use that as the hub in the house though.  I've been looking at individual products to figure out what brands to target and settled on Nest for a few things.  Thermostat and doorbell for sure.  Big fan of the Hello's ability to tell you who is at the door and play prerecorded messages.  Also looking at the security system as it'd be nice to have that natively on the same platform. \n\nMy understanding is Nest and SmartThings don't officially play nice together though.  **So if I wanted to use ST or webCore to create automations, would I be fairly SOL with Nest products**? I think there are some third party options, but most of what I found went over my head.  \n\nAutomation Example: If Hello recognizes my face, unlock the door.  If ST senses me leave the house, and the house is empty, arm security (Nest Secure) and make sure doors are locked.  Things like that.",

The downside is that I have to use audio sources that can be cast to a Chromecast. They have optical out so sound quality is not an issue (depending on the service you use). At only $20, much more palatable. ",

I'd probably stick to using a keypad though - and you're correct, although Z-Wave has some scene controllers, they're nothing like an Insteon keypad.  For lighting, I'd go with Insteon hands-down, which also gives you access to some other devices that are Insteon-unique as well, such as FanLinc and IOLinc, and 240V load controllers at a reasonable price.  Oh, and I use mine for Smoke/CO detectors as well, which being an Insteon system means that even with a major electrical fire taking out a huge amount of the house, the lighting system (or what's left of it) will still respond to smoke/CO alarms without a central controller.  Remember, despite what it may seem sometimes, Insteon is the newer protocol compared to Z-Wave and was designed to combine Z-Wave and X10's advantages. :)\n\nFor audio, I use a Niles MRC-6430 for that, and it sounds like it would meet your needs perfectly, but it is a bit pricy, and external control is about zilch, your AV stuff will be its own island.  There are some others, but at the DIY level I don't believe that any properly allow you to have a TV/HT system as one zone and still address it all using the same UI with full audio multiplexing support across both systems.\n\nCheck out Blue Iris for cameras if you want your own NVR, it integrates to most good HA systems natively, and doesn't require subscription.\n\nGet Z-Wave for locks (it can also be controlled by the ISY), and I'm adding in some Z-Wave outlets as well to act as Z-Wave repeaters getting to the locks.",

So I'm guessing they won't work for me, but I also know how little I do know, and there may be someone far smarter than myself that figured a way around this problem.\n\nOtherwise, does anyone have a good solution they recommend for voice commands that don't require an outside internet connection?  It looks like Jasper (running on pi's with a USB mic) may be an avenue to pursue, but I'm very new to this automation thing, and some of the blogs I've read are a little older, so I wanted to see if there was a more tried and true method that I just haven't heard of.\n  \n",

I'm really struggling lately on how to get everything working intelligently with each other. My smart product addiction started when I just wanted some lights to be able to hit the switch from bed so to speak, but slowly spiraled into more and more products. I'm at the point where my home is full of all sorts of smart products but I wouldn't call it a smart home as there's very little automation and function working together.\n\nLet's start with what I got:\n\n1. A whole house of hue lights, definitely a mistake cost a fortune but I have them now so oh well\n2. Brand new August smart lock\n3. Ring Video doorbell\n4. A small cloud connected security camera\n5. Enough Alexa devices to take over my home\n6. A Sonos playbar (and soon to be surround sound)\n7. An Amazon Fire tablet for control (my biggest issue)\n8. a computer I could probably use as a server\n9. and finally a SmartThings starter kit with the hub, door sensor, motion detector, and outlet\n\nI have all this, but yet the house still feels very dumb. I've looked through a lot of vCloudInfo's blog and while it is the dream, most of his posts aren't detailed enough for me to follow and I can't manage to use it as a tutorial. I guess what I'm looking for is some in depth guide to connect my home more intelligently. A lot of what I've found has been a little over my head, but I need the tablet to not be as useless as it is out of the box (how do I get HomeAssistant on it for example, let alone FloorPlan? Is OpenHAB better?)\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions, much appreciated",

Wired alarm systems are always superior to wireless.\n\n2) Run Ethernet everywhere, and have it terminate in a utility closet to a patch panel, with a big rackmount switch (don't use a heating/hot water closet as double duty though, make it its own thing if you can).  At least two to each TV - whatever you think you'll need in terms of Ethernet, run a second alongside it, because that CAT6 cable can be used for a myriad of other uses besides Ethernet once it's in there.  Also run CAT6 to anyplace you think you may want an in-wall keypad, and run them to ceilings for wireless APs.\n\n3) Speaking of equipment Make sure it's \\*at least\\* big enough for a 25U 2-post rack, at 1 meter device depth, and cooled.  Mine is just an open space in an unfinished basement that's inside of the house's thermal envelope, so it's heated and cooled to well within tolerances at all time,  but the more enclosed the more you need a dedicated cooling system because that stuff will get hot.\n\n4) Run speaker wire back to the same location closet from in ceiling/in-wall speakers.  You can choose the speakers and head-end system later, but run the wires now.\n\n5) When you get a controller, seriously think hard about which one you want.  Sure, something running on an RPI or cloud reliant is fine if you can fix it when something goes wrong, but a Crestron or Elan or UDI system starts making more sense when you need to to work when away, 100% of the time, every time.\n\n6) Ask how much a static IP costs fro the ISP, so you have 100% reliable remote access to it.\n\n7) Consider a point to point VPN tunnel to your main house - that way any network devices at home can be accessed in your vacation home and vis versa.  Provided the speed is fast enough on both ends, you can stream securely from a Plex server or run advanced configurations through the VPN tunnel.",

Besides DRM'd TV and Blu-Ray there's not a whole heck of a lot of other support anymore, but I've moved to Roku Ultras for streaming nowadays.\n\nBut now that you're throwing out things like aliasing (which, thanks to low pass filters, isn't a reason for interference) and capacitance on speaker wire which, for all intents and purposes, isn't a thing.  You may need lower gauge for longer runs, but speaker wire sound quality is dominated by resistance.  This is getting into Golden Ears arguments, and I generally will avoid those at all costs.\n\nSuffice it to say: for whole house audio and for a couple of HT rooms, consolidated wiring is much preferable in an automated home and is how it's done in professional installations by people paid to make things sound the way they were meant to sound.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: the likely reason you're hearing interference from the 2.4 GHz ISM band \u2026 which subwoofers have been at least basically shielded against since the 1960's thanks to microwave ovens \u2026 is because of something in the power supply that has roughly a 13 cm or fraction thereof (1/4 wavelength or 3.2 cm is common to pick up such things) resonance.  Find it, wrap a ferrite core around it, and it'll go away.  This is doubly indicated by the fact that moving an antenna (which chases the wave polarization) changed it.  That's how you get a 2.4 GHz signal into the hearing range on a subwoofer, is because the internal working frequencies of the power supply are much higher.

            "Automation Ideas for a Limited Condo?\nLooking to get into home automation more, but I live in a condo that's not quite set up to do much. For now I just have a GH mini in our main living space.\n\nFor example, we don't have electricity bills, they're built into condo fees at a set rate - so while I can get a smart t-stat it won't help costs or anything. Might still get one eventually just to control over voice rather than physically. It controls a heat pump.\n\nWe cannot change out door locks either so no security stuff. Smoke alarms built into building fire alarm system. Fairly happy with fire TV with Alexa remote already and as far as I'm aware there's no way to integrate that. Can't do much for wake up routines besides basic alarms since I wake up earlier before my SO. \n\nSome ideas so far:\n\n- Send myself an alert when my dog barks while out, and potentially emit a bad noise (condo doesn't take well to dogs borkin)\n\n- Lights obviously, but it will have to be pretty much just switches controlling dumb lights since I cannot seem to find nice Edison smart bulbs and most of our lights are exposed Edisons. Can anyone recommend a good classic rocker smart switch? \n\nAny further good ideas so I can pursue them? Preferably a bit on the cheaper side but I'll consider anything. One question, I am happy to buy a hub if needed but if I'm only doing lights is it cheaper just to skip the hub? Or are the zwave/ZigBee switches noticeably cheaper than WiFi switches? I live in a cold area of Canada if that helps any.\n\nI am vaguely familiar to this stuff as my work relates to the construction of commercial building systems.\n\nThanks a bunch!!",

Complex schedules with presence, or combining light levels with motion sensors would probably be best with a hub. More to the point, a hub will free you from brand constraints. \n\nSee my \"[getting started](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/9xfccf/mega_getting_started_thread/)\" thread for more automation ideas (scroll to the bullets).",

My husabdna nd I are redoing just about every aspect of our home, and along the way we would like to include a lot of smart features. Our preferred features are:\n\n-video doorbell and security cameras\n\n-smart lighting which we can change for the moment (such as \"movie mode\" for the living room, different settings for the bedroom, and ideally a programmable system where we could say, set up \"morning mode\" where the lights come up gradually either on schedule or with the push of a button). Color changing bulb options for this are a plus but not a \"need.\" Indoor and outdoor lighting settings a must.\n\n-smart thermostat (would be great if it could include our heated floors in kitchen and bath. we have a boiler with 3 zones, so if there is a \"mother/queen\" unit and some drones that would be cool)\n\n-smart garage door opener/closer\n\n-Keyless entry at the front door (key sharing is a bonus)\n\n-Operation of blinds in certain rooms (again, like the living room for movie time, bedroom for night/morning)\n\n-other fun smart features, like connecting our sprinklers to our weather station, telling the system to start the coffee, etc. \n\nWe know that most or all of these things already exist, but would like to choose one system (IE Google vs Amazon vs Apple vs Ring vs Whatever) that can operate them all, ideally both on a tablet (or similar) to stay at home and our phones for some things. We don't want to have 5 different remotes or apps. Does Google Home operate most of those things?\n\nWe did have a Kevo smart lock at our last house, but there were a lot of limitations with that since it only worked with certain phones (even though it was bluetooth?) and you otherwise needed the key fob.\n\nI am open to suggestions or even being told we need to wait, but at the least we would like to get the doorbell and cameras set up pretty shortly.\n\nOur main concern is one cohesive, overall system tat we can operate without too much hassle, like in the movies. Am I crazy?",

The technical differences mostly don't matter. They're both mesh, so they won't act as extenders for each other. Despite that, despite what /u/jds013 it's best to get an automation controller that can handle both and not worry too much about which is which. In general, there are more powered devices using Z-Wave, and more small battery powered devices (like sensors) using Zigbee. \n\nLight bulbs are usually Zigbee; I don't think I've ever seen a Z-Wave bulb, though maybe I've not been looking. However, I recommend the Hue system (with non-hue cheaper bulbs), which uses a sub-set of Zigbee. If using Hue bulbs, the Zigbee/Z-Wave issue is somewhat moot, except to know which bulbs use the same Zigbee subset - Sylvania, Cree, IKEA and Gledopto. (Ecosmart, Sengled, Centralite, Jasco and Xiaomi Aqara use normal Zigbee.)",

But some things are fairly stable, I think. You'll get a bunch of opinions in this subreddit, but here are mine:\n\nUse Z-Wave for home control - that is, get Z-Wave lighting controls (I like GE/Jasco, but HomeSeer, Inovelli, Zooz, and others make excellent products), Z-Wave thermostats (I have a fine $80 [GoControl](https://amzn.com/B00ZIRV40K)), Z-Wave door locks (Schlage Connect), Z-Wave motion/door/window/temperature/light sensors (Monoprice is a good value). The Samsung SmartThings hub is a great place to start. With this, you'll control all these items through a single smartphone app; you can easily create scenes, and automate lights with timers and motion detection; and use smartphone presence to detect things; and add or remove codes for the lock's touchpad; and get full voice control from Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. You can also create routines to set all thermostats to 68, or set all thermostats to 65 and turn off &lt;some&gt; lights when everyone leaves.\n\nZ-Wave can't help with cameras or doorbells, but check out [wirecutter.com](https://wirecutter.com) for recommendations.\n\nYou'll need electrician skills to install switches, but most of the other items are easy to add.",

I said they\u2019re set to lower automatically when the sun directly shines into her room, which quickly raises the temp in the room to over 85 degrees F. \n\nMy wife then joined in and said she hates it when hers do that and she hates everything else I\u2019ve put in our (smart) home. At that point, I freaked, left the table and took down everything. I mean everything - all the lights, the garage door opener, the door locks, the thermostats, everything. I cancelled all music services, removed all HomePods, the Roomba, the family calendar - and I was pretty shocked to find out how little time tearing it all down took compared to putting it all up and making it work. \n\nI had hoped she\u2019d tell me that some of it was actually useful once she\u2019s realized that she now needs to take a key with her on her dog walks, has to turn on the hallway lights manually and needs to use an old AC remote to get her room cooled down. Nope. The only thing she\u2019s mentioned so far is that it\u2019ll now suck to give our dog sitter access to the house. \n\nI\u2019m not sure whether she\u2019s too proud to admit that things actually worked pretty well and made our lives considerably easier and more organized, or whether she really thinks things are better this way. In any case, I guess we\u2019ll be living in 1985 again now. \n\nThe only thing I noticed however is that the kids have no clue how to work thing without voice control. They now can\u2019t let anyone in the door as they can\u2019t reach the cupboard with the keys, they initially had no idea why the lights wouldn\u2019t turn on when they walked into the hallway and why there\u2019s no more music in the living room and their own rooms. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll adjust.\n\nSo two things: I\u2019d be interested in how you guys made home control compatible with the wishes of your better halves. \n\nAnd: to those who have just gone ahead and done things without consulting with your partners first - be careful. \n\nAnyway, I haven\u2019t been this pissed since my dad took away my RC car 37 years ago because I had bumped it into his Mitsubishi.",

Due to the issues this caused with our relationship in our new home i went about it a different way. For starters the technology is so much better so that helps I am using homekit and have 200+ devices the difference is I always discussed each item with my wife and more importantly EVERY functional device I have installed works as a stand alone device as well as an automated one and most are from well known manufactures that put functionality and security first and automation second. Schlage sense, caseta wireless, serena shades ( these were a hard sell but that was a cost thing.) ecobee, velux skylight,first alert smoke alarms, chamberlain myQ, Rachio etc. \n\nThat being said I did install sensors and monitors but those are for me to collect data and make a valid argument into automating something. \n\nI also talk with my wife and daughter before creating automations and very few of them are scheduled most are scenes in homekit. The scheduled items are sunrise and sunset for porch lights and some interior lights. Auto door lock at a set time each night,Sprinklers,exhaust fans, Hvac and the skylight.  \n\nThe scenes I have created that are used regularly are good morning this opens some shades and turns on some lights.  I\u2019m leaving turns off lights locks doors closed shades and skylight that\u2019s pretty much it. \n\nSure using the blinds to maintain temp is a great idea and when we are not  home they are closed but we are a family with constantly changing schedules so the rest is just not practical. \n\nWith the use of some air quality sensors and some other logged data ecobee etc. I am able to bring up things I would like to do with some data to back it up. We can the discuss cost vs livability and decide if it makes sense. \n\nThis path has brought my family to love the automation and use it more often. Even to use the homepods for control something that I only used for quite some time. It has also not only been non contentious but has even brought many compliments from the family.",

That's an unnecessary recommendation. There are plenty of ways to protect equipment that don't involve fuses, including just building it to handle the circuit rating. If the product carries a UL listing, it can generally be trusted to be electrically safe, internal fuses or none.\n\nIt's very common in England to have fuses in plugs, but that's because of the inherently less safe ring circuit design that is so prevalent there. It's not common for residential equipment in the US to have its own overcurrent protection because our circuits carry a lower rating to begin with.",

UL fucking loves money, and they don't make money by handing out a label to whomever asks. No, they make their standards more difficult to meet and their test criteria more involved and expensive. Manufacturing defects are always a possibility, but I trust that the design of any product with a UL label is safe when used for it's intended purpose and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nIntertek (the owner of the ETL label) usually tests to published UL standards, but they're not as well trusted in the industry. They're known as the lab that manufacturers go to when they don't want to pay UL prices. Having that label is better than having none at all, but things I'm being paid to install en masse I'd rather be UL.",

It was a 3 gang box and the bad one was in the middle.  If it was a normal dimmer, I'd just pop it out, go back to the van and get a regular dimmer, change it, put it back in and be on my way.\n\nWith Adorne, everything is connected to a metal back plate (which has to be grounded or nothing will work by the way), so it meant I had to take the other 2 out also and they have these wimpy little connections in the back that had popped out so what would have taken me 5 minutes turned into a half hour just to troubleshoot the damn thing and then order one and come back the next week and then take everything out again and put it back in.  Complete waste of time.  I would stick with standard decora devices.\n\nWith Radiant, I've only seen it in the showroom of our supplier but Legrand has never been known for automation.  They bought a whole home automation company called Vantage a few years ago and got rid of a bunch of their older styles (many of which people still have), shook the sales teams around, got rid of loyal dealers (ahem) and it really doesn't seem like they know what they're doing IMO.\n\nThey make nice GFCI's, outlets, switches, plug molds, etc. but they are very new to home automation and came with this line to compete in the DIY market.  Will you find replacement parts in 5 years? Who knows?  Are these reliable? Who knows?  Do you want to be a beta tester for them? I'd stick with Lutron. They've done this longer than anybody else and are proven.  For as long as I've been in this business I've seen automation products come and go (Lightolier, all kinds of X-10, Wattstopper, etc.) but Lutron is always the one that's standing.",

            "Which Smart Robot Vacuum is right for me?\nSo, we got a robot vacuum for Christmas (Eufy 15 C) and we are in love with \"Roberta\".  Vacuuming is one of our least favorite chores and one of our dogs is terrified of the big upright, consequently we dragged the time between vacuuming out and got the upright out once a week which is not ideal with 3 dogs. Roberta changed everything! She is super quiet and the dogs don't mind her at all.  She runs every day and the house has never looked cleaner.   \n\n\nThe downside to Roberta is, she is a \"dumb\" robot, you can only have on scheduled run per day, so we are considering placing her upstairs and getting another robot for the downstairs.    \nUltimately I would like a smart robot that can clean specific zones on schedules and via voice. So I would like to be able to say \"Alexa, clean the kitchen\" and the robot does just that and  be able to schedule the vacuum so it cleans the bathroom every morning after getting ready etc. Mopping would be a nice additional feature but the ones that do are apparently not super good at it anyway. \n\nApparently none of them are quiet there yet, but it looks like they are just a software update or two away from these features.   \n\n\nAfter hours of research the following robots seem to be the most promising: Roborock S5,  Deebot 900 and Neato D7. \n\n  \nI have been doing some price matching and it seems I can get the $356 from Newegg with a Euro plug but would not have any warranty whatsoever or for $569 from Amazon with 1 year warranty. Correct me if I'm wrong even if I bought the Roborock from Newegg with extended Visa warranty I would not be covered because there is no US warranty to extend?  \nThe Neato D7 is $589 on Amazon, it checks all the boxes and Alexa room cleaning seems to be the next logical software update for them.   \nThe Deebot  I can get for $279, it has all the features but then again it has a smaller battery, smaller receptacle, less power than the Roborock. \n\n  \nI tend to want to go for the Roborock  but the lack of any kind of warranty scares me, and if I buy it from Amazon I might as well go for the Deebot for $20 more.\n\n  \nAny input or advise would be greatly appreciated, as I just can't make up my mind.   \nHappy New Year!

            "Z Wave Plus Water Sensor with probe suggestions\nAlright so here is my situation.\n\nMy sump pump has a mains powered primary pump and a battery powered backup pump. \n\nIt's rare but sometimes the rain is so intense in a short time both pumps just can't keep up even going at the same time. I was lucky the last time since I was downstairs and I heard the faint beep of the battery backup alarm going off as both pumps kicked on but the water was still slowly creeping up. \n\nIt was lucky again because soon after we got a third portable pump powered on blowing water into a nearby sink were we finally able to get ahead of the water. If I would have lost electric during that storm I would have been F***ED but that's beyond the point. \n\nIf I wouldn't have heard that faint alarm it would have eventually flooded my finished basement which it has done twice before, you haven't lived until you have a titanic recreation going on in your downstairs kitchen with a waterfall blowing out of your microwave and the lights flickering on and off.\n\n\nSo anyway I'm looking for a wire probe based Z wave plus water sensor I can mount on the wall and stick the probe down in the hole where the water would be if the main pump couldn't keep up anymore which would give me time to get the backup generator and portable pump running. I found this one I linked to below but it doesn't seem to be available anywhere for sale. I also know Aeotec makes one but after you buy all the parts and crap for it, it's like 80 bucks. If that is the only option I'll go that route but i wanted to get the community to respond for help.\n\nhttps://products.z-wavealliance.org/products/2551\n\n\n",

The smart multifunctional gateway\n2. Door and window sensors\n3. Some smart lights. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGateway: First problem I have is that there are various versions and brands of it. Xiaomi, Mijia and Aqara. Which one is better, newer and compatible with what is a total confusion for me. There aren't model numbers on these that I can search things by so I need to understand which one should I go for. I am the kind of person who will pay a little more but get latest hardware and also most compatible. I want to have (if possible) just one application to control all things from and if not possible, Apple Homekit and Google Assistant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoor and window sensors: This SHOULD be straightforward because I think sensors from either the mijia brand or aqara brand should work with either gateways but if I am wrong, please let me know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmart lights: One function I prefer is local connectivity so I think zigbee is the way. As I understand, zigbee allows you to control devices even if your gateway itself has lost internet. As long as your phone and gateway are on the same wifi, you should be fine. Again, there is yeelight/xiaomi/aqara bulbs so not sure which one is compatible with what. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice on either of the 3 things would be great if someone can help. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDhaval ",

                    "&gt;Just read through your getting started guide and it seems this place is for a very advanced and busy users.\n\nI would rewrite the guide to be even more user-friendly, but I'm actually involved in writing an e-book for beginners. When I have completed that project, I will revisit the post, though that will probably be too late for your needs ;-)\n\n&gt;Once this is setup, I can start on raspberry pi and these advanced automation controllers.\n\n\nTo be honest, I'm not real familiar with Pi setups. I have an RPi, but only to add features to my Hubitat \"hub\". Compared to Hubitat or Wink, a RPi running Home Assistant isn't actually a cheap solution. My setup, with a case and heatsink-fan, was more expensive than my Hubitat (and my SmartThings). However, that's also not including a Zigbee and/or Z-Wave radio. All combined, an RPi setup will probably be $150 to $200. It also took several hours to get it up and running, though I was not installing automation software. If you have Linux experience, it would presumably be a lot smoother.\n\n&gt;I really want someone to tell me pros and cons of this new aqara gateway used in the UK.\n\nI trust you saw my \"mega review\" concerning Hubitat, and presume you've decided against it. If not... In short, the only major issue with it is that there's no app for remote access (it's supposed to be released in April, but will probably be rudimentary, but no feature set has been published). If that's not an issue, I have no reservations in recommending it as a cheaper alternative to an RPi (though more expensive than SmartThings; see below). Nonetheless, with that presumption in mind....\n\nI've never used the Aqara hub or read up on it. I doubt it's a serious contender, but I would bet that the software side of it slapped together garbage. If you are short on money to be able to get both an RPi and devices to actually automate (and not interested in or can afford the Hubitat), then I'd recommend a SmartThings as a good place to learn, with some caveats. First, I'd suggest planning on transitioning to something else. Aside from being cloud-based, it's a capable device, but I just do not trust Samsung's leadership to not screw it up (more than they already have). Second, don't even bother with the built-in automation methods (such as the Smart Light App, or \"routines\"). Start with using WebCoRe. It will probably be more than enough to handle anything you might want to do, but if not, then learn how to write your own apps.\n\n&gt;I am also trying to understand why these gateways require their server set to China and not any other region.\n\nShort answer is that Xiaomi isn't concentrating on the European and American markets. Although they do have US and European plug options for appliances, even their cellphones lack the US frequencies. That would by another concern with the Aqara. I know it does not support Z-Wave, which does have a different frequency in Europe, but not sure on Zigbee. I presume not, or else their sensors wouldn't work at all outside China.\n\nMy biggest concern for you would be starting out learning a system that simply won't apply. At least get as close to your ideal setup at the beginning as you can afford. Again, I don't know for sure, but getting the Aqara might end up being  like buying a bicycle to learn how to drive a stick-shift.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything, or the same thing again if I didn't answer your question.",

                    "So here is an update. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Samsung ST hub installed\n2. Two IKEA white bulbs setup. The controls are a bit weird for colour temperature. I expected a simple warm to cool. But it works from warm being 0 to 4000k which is like 1/3 way to cool. It's probably because the bulb doesn't support more than 4000k and that's fine but the UI should adjust accordingly. \n3. Aquara door sensor was tricky to set up. I couldn't tell u how I did it, just kept pressing the reset button and suddenly it appeared after like 14th try. Work beautifully tho. Automation is limited to a notification for now and notification is around 10 to 15 seconds late but it works well. \n4. Nest: Now this is a nightmare. I have a Nest thermostat and I followed the complicated process to add it and though it appears to have integrated well, its kinda read only right now. Shows status but changing temperature doesn't work. Also need to use the classic app, new app doesn't support the \"smart apps\" which is needed for Nest integration. I have posted this in community forum so I hope someone responds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIKEA bulbs are probably the cheapest right now but I also have a Zigbee version of Aqara white bulb on order so I will see how that goes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me, next steps are\n\n1. Get a voice alert for door sensor so I can use it for intrusion alarm. \n2. Set Up a phone call notification somehow when intrusion is detected. \n3. Once the first two are taken care of, deploy more door sensors to lock down security part and thoroughly test it. \n4. Then deploy motion sensors to automate lights. \n5. Add more bulbs, eventually replace all bulbs with white bulbs at least if not colour ones. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now this is good 2yrs for me because i am going to take it slow and buy things when i find them on deal and not full price. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will try the  WebCoRe and let you know how it goes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, thanks for responding and I really enjoy this conversation, I hope it goes on forever :D :P !",

                    "Sorry for the delayed response. Been busy busy. Just so you know, the Aqara bulb is ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation), and the IKEA is ZLL (Zigbee Light Link). The IKEA should (but not sure) be able to connect to the Aqara bridge, but the Xiaomi won't connect to the IKEA bridge. Both will connect to the ST, but the IKEA will sorta convert to ZHA. Not sure with IKEA, but when Hue bulbs (which also use ZLL) are connected as ZHA, they aren't easy to switch from ZHA back to ZLL. But Hue bulbs can't easily be factor reset - IKEA you just turn it on and off six times.\n\nXiaomi does off a multipurpose sensor, but without as much stuff. The \"vibration\" sensor has tilt, impact, and acceleration. I have a couple of them to automate the washer and dryer, but haven't used them except for a basic \"proof of concept\" test. The humidity sensor has temp and pressure. I have three of them. I've not spent a lot of time with calibration, but they seem wildly inaccurate with humidity (not tracked temp or pressure). I also have a Samsung multipurpose, but hasn't worked since I installed it, most likely due to network range and not a defect. That is to say, I don't know. \n\nNext on my list, other than actually finishing all those projects, will be to add leak sensors, which will be by far the easiest thing to do. Just toss them under a sink, and add a notification alert. Then on to motion sensors..... I've got two installed in my son's room, and they seem to do okay, but he hasn't filled out the beta test report forms.\n\nAlso check out Gledopto bulbs. They are ZLL and full color. They come in two different wattages. I got a low-wattage on and put it in my son's room. He reported that it would would flicker/blink a few times an hour, and the color brightness is a bit disappointing (but white brightness was as expected). I ordered the higher wattage one, and found it too large to fit in any of the light fixtures, so swapped his out (as a lamp where size not an issue). I've not asked how the new one is doing, but the low wattage one seems to be doing fine in its new location - I've not noticed it flicker, but YMMV.\n\nI've not tried IKEA. I may get one just to test it out, but my long term goal is 100% full color bulbs. Same with Xiaomi, though I have no interest in trying it, since it can't connect to my Hue hub.",

            "Smart Lock recommendations\nFellow reddit users, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGetting a new door soon, and decided I would like a smart lock. I spent a lot of time reading reviews about the array of products, and have hit analysis paralysis. Too much outdated information, lots of reviews ignoring systemic issues with locks that appear frequently in consumer reviews.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblems that I need a smart lock to solve in order of priority:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife loses her keys in her purse about 80% of the time and it takes on average about 30-45 seconds for her to dig them out and open up the door. Most of the time it's literally faster for me to set down whatever or whoever I'm carrying and get my keys out. This has been a problem with her forever, and a change in behaviors is unlikely at this point. Smart lock would ideally sense her phone nearby and unlock the door without any voice command needed. I consider this the primary reason to get the lock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYoung kids that need to open the door. Very familiar with using a pin to unlock devices, but still struggling to use a key properly because of reasons. My keys will often get left in the door lock when they open the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLocking the door on a schedule. I'd prefer the door to automatically lock and unlock at certain times of the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional considerations:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot willing to pay a monthly fee, or reoccurring fees like ekeys for anything, because f\\*\\*\\* that. I know ekeys are free for now, but I refuse to be someones monthly revenue stream for a damn lock. I'd rather stick with a mechanical lock in that case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExtra hub needed is okay. I have a hue hub, but I understand it's limitations. If a different hub such as Z-wave or whatever is required, that's okay. If required I would prefer a lock that is compatible with 3rd party hub such SmartThings. Not interested in a Schlage brand hub, for example. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe use the Apple ecosystem, but I'm not a user of voice commands. I personally don't like doing it. I don't use, nor will I ever have a system like Alexa or Google Home, so these features are irrelevant. We do not have an Apple TV, and if required as a hub, probably wouldn't get used much for anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would have liked a keyless door, but my new door is coming pre-bored from the factory for 2 holes, so I need a lock that is designed for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, there was one lock I tested in the store, I don't remember which one it was. It had the most annoyingly loud beep whenever it locked or unlocked. That's a complete deal breaker. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your input!",

Pretty much all smart lock solutions are just the deadbolt, you'll need to get a separate knob or lever for the other hole.

If so, I'd just make the deadbolt smart, and not lock the doorknob. Frankly, a doorknob offer little protection anyways - one kick by a middling sized out of shape child could snap one off.\n\n&gt;Lastly, there was one lock I tested in the store, I don't remember which one it was. It had the most annoyingly loud beep whenever it locked or unlocked. That's a complete deal breaker.\n\nNot sure why the sound is so important to you, but I have a Yale, and it's pretty loud. However, it's not that bad when the batteries are full, and if the bolt has a smooth slide into the hole. In other words, YMMV, but... it's going to have a solid \"errrrrrrrrrgnt\" to it. That may be something you could focus on in reviews to narrow the field. ",

We designed it to work with ANY OTA firmware. 2) The firmware on our dimmers and switches has not changed in the past year, so there's no need to update unless your switches are a few years old.",

I have 10 camera\u2019s across my account and my wifes, while sharing the privileges across accounts, which works out to $0 in monthly costs. (You get 5 camera\u2019s with 1 week of recordings for free per account) So weigh that possibility if you don\u2019t mind saving $120+ per year. \n\nI have heard that you HAVE to pay a monthly premium on Nest and Ring which is the reason I avoided them. \n\nThe ONLY downside I find with Arlo is that because it is completely wireless it runs on a Lithium battery. Once the weather dips below -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) the battery freezes and the camera turns off. HOWEVER, you can buy 20ft long waterproof charging cables for them from Wasserstein. So I have all my outdoor camera\u2019s plugged in at all times. When the temp dips too low, the camera\u2019s still operate from the direct power. But it\u2019s also secure as if someone sees the cable and unplugs it thinking it stops the camera, it just continues recording using the battery. \n\nThey also don\u2019t have floodlight\u2019s as well like you are looking for. But Arlo makes Security lights that work with the Camera\u2019s as well. \n\nAnother option if you don\u2019t mind a monthly subscription is Arlo\u2019s new camera line coming out. 4K video. Built in Security light. But it needs a subscription. ",

Where do I start? Took several attempts to get wifi going. It finally connected and it does function as it should. Heres where the problems began.  The plastic housing is about the worst design to ever come out of China. The top half just pops right off any time you touch it. I had glue the thing together to keep it intact. During one of the several times the plastic housing fell apart the reset button also popped off the circuit board. I cant quite figure out how that goes back together so I guess I'll just leave it out. Hopefully I'll never need to reset the stupid thing. Also, don't over tighten your screws when attaching wires. Nothing holding the terminals in place but solder so it'll bend and eventually break off with just a little bit of effort.  \n\n\nWorse 8 bucks I ever spent. Wish I had bought a Wemo. I have my entire house done with them and never a problem. I don't expect this thing to last long. When it dies I will never buy another Sonoff.  \n\n\nEDIT: An hour after this review I found out this device was not compatible with the automation software I use unless I want to solder some pins on and reflash the firmware. No thanks. Ended up throwing it in the trash can and using a Wemo instead. ",

But why does Logitech have such a tighter grip on single device commands? I've heard - throw away all your other remotes - well that means I would be relying 100% on logitech and that's exactly what they want me to do. If you think about it, there really is no benefit for the consumer to do that. \n\nTrust me, I get the activities thing. I can see how this could all work nicely with someones setup. But please don't throw the harmony hub as the end all, be all solution. \n\nI have a Windows 10 machine that doubles as my desktop AND my 10-foot user interface ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-foot\\_user\\_interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-foot_user_interface)). I use an air mouse to navigate windows (MX3 Air Mouse Remote), which Harmony's \"smart\" remote can't do. --Which kinda defeats the whole purpose of a single universal remote. So again, as soon as you step outside of their ecosystem the whole thing crumbles. Plus, do zero harmony hub owners also have kids? I've found if there's a way to break something they will. So something so temperamental with getting out of sync has caused me endless hours of trying to find workarounds.\n\nEnter the broadlink mini - I got mine in the mail last night and had everything I had been trying to do for the last 2 months **setup within 2 hours!!!!!**\n\n\\~Remember, the Harmony Hub hardware is 100% capable of everything the Broadlink can do, plug more. But **they've** **chosen** this convoluted route and mentality of activities only. All of this could be solved if they loosened up on single devices commands and allowing other services/devices to integrate with it better. \n\nDownvote me into the abyss. I don't care, I would rather get this off my chest than worry about being less abrasive for  Karma points. \n\nBTW I have a Harmony Hub for sale if anyone wants one....",

I'm completely remodelling the appartment, including new electricty wiring, switches, sockets, lights, AC, etc., so I guess I'm in the \"best\" position to switch to home automation now, than later. \n\nI have already decided I'll want to be able to remotely control AC and heating through HomeKit (e.g., to warm up/cool down the appartment before coming home from work, or warm up the appartment before getting out of bed in the morning), and I have no issue with that to be honest.\n\nI know I don't want any smart lock or so - I just don't trust that technology enough, to secure my main door to the appartment, to be completely honest. And I have no idea if insurance companies wouldn't make trouble because of it in case of theft. I wish there was a nice cheap solution for indoor blinds, but there seems to be none, so I'm skipping that - I have my blinds open most of the time anyways, since indoor blinds kinda suck. :/\n\nThe issue I'm torn about the most are lights. I know I could just put some smart lighbulbs there and be done with it, but what to do with the switches on the walls?\n\nIf I understand it correctly (and please, correct me if I'm wrong), I need to keep all switches on the wall in the \"On\" position all the time, and just use my phone/some external switch to turn the lights on/off? Given that I have 11 separate light circuits planned (in a kinda small flat - hall, 1 bedroom, walking closet, living room, kitchen and a bathroom w/ toilet), it seems like a bitch work to turn these lights on/off from phone instead of just hitting the switches at the walls, if they are going to be reasonably placed?\n\nI like the features like being able to change the temperature/color of the light bulb (or just simply dim it), but I'm not really sure if it's worthwhile? Also, while I could get used to control it through separate means and not touch the switches on the walls (which are kinda needed, e.g., if you want to change the lightbulb when it dies?), what about my guests? They will be used to hitting the switches, and will turn off my lights, and screw up the smart aspect of it anyways?\n\nI'll be glad for any opinions, including your experience with guests and your smart lights.",

With the switches, I don't have to worry about anyone getting confused because the switch part of it operates just like a normal light switch does.\n\nI ditched the smart bulbs, and now have over 40 smart switches and dimmers in my house that operate standard white LED bulbs.",

The switches have their own mains to 5/3v power supply for the \"smarts\" built into them, so both live and neutral are required.   \nThe US I think are lucky, their home wiring's typically go from the switch up, meaning all wall sockets have neutral in them. I am unsure of Europes standard method, perhaps with smart homes things are changing.   \n\n\nMy recommendation is to make sure you get live/neutral in all wall switches, and since smart switches are expensive you can simply replace the dumb switches over time, rather than going all in.

With wink, I was primarily z-wave based devices with a few IoT (wifi) devices like nest and ring. \n\nI recently switched over and picked up a $40 Aeon Labs Z-stick. It acts as a local z-wave controller you can plug into any Mac / Linux / Windows / RPi device. You just have to install the controller software already mentioned in other posts to interface with it. Some are commercially supported, some are open source. I went with Indigo as I found it had fantastic out of box support for almost every z-wave device on the market and a large development community producing very good plugins for the IoT and other network or wifi based devices.\n\nAt the end of the day, I have ZERO latency and 100% end to end encryption on my LOCAL network. I was shocked how much latency that phone homing in wink was causing. Since moving to Z-Stick and Indigo, there is more latency by pressing the wall switch than when I use the iPhone app. The only things that still phone home are the IoT devices which I am slowly replacing with devices I can run Locally.  \n",

            "Smart Automatic Pet Feeder Comparison Review\n \n\nI\u2019ve been on the hunt for a better smart automated pet feeder for my 60lb dog, and so far have tested the **Dogness Smart Pet Feeder**, **Petnet 2nd Gen**, and **Petwant/Jempet/Wopet (pf-103)**. I thought hopefully a in-depth break down of my experience with them may help other people. The Petwant was my first smart pet feeder and I\u2019ve owned the same one for more than 2.5 years and everything still works fine since the day I bought it. So I can say with confidence my overall experience with it as being, in general, a reliable feeder considering it has lasted without hardware failure or motor burnout this long albeit it would only really work in a single pet cat or small dog household. \n\nI only tested the Petnet and Dogness for a few days so far, so my reviews are based on my experience with them thus far and may update my review of the Dogness feeder once I\u2019ve had it longer. Unfortunately, the Petnet showed so much wifi network and app failure early on after testing for a few days I decided to just return it and will not be able to give a long-term use review unless I somehow get one for free later down the road to review. \n\nOut of all the feeders, I will keep on using the Dogness Smart Pet Feeder with my large dog who eats large kibble and give away my Petwant feeder to a friend who only has a cat.\n\n**Control Variables:** I tested the pet feeder using Wellness Core Large Breed Dog food (worst - pyramid shape and large size kibble) and Victor Nutra Pro Dog food (best - round shape and small-sized kibble). The network router I was using is a Google Wifi mesh router. I was running all my pet feeder android ver. apps on a Google Pixel 1 phone. \n\n# Dogness: [https://www.amazon.com/DOGNESS-Automatic-Smart-Camera-Feeder/dp/B07JVSGYG4/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049600&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dogness+automatic](https://www.amazon.com/DOGNESS-Automatic-Smart-Camera-Feeder/dp/B07JVSGYG4/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049600&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dogness+automatic)\n\n**Capacity:** Claims 6 liters or 6.5 lbs of food  / I measured 20 cups\n\n**Time:** Military\n\n**Meal Units:** Metric gram portions.\n\n**Jam Occurrence:** Never Jammed Yet\n\nEasy to get to connect to WiFi. Always worked on the first try to bind feeder to the app. App registers pet feeder as offline during app use unless you constantly restart and reopen the app again to reconnect wifi to the feeder. However, after newly opening the app, the app always is able to quickly find and connect to the pet feeder and camera on the pet feeder.\n\n**Camera/Video Quality:** Claims unknown specified HD camera. Claims wide angle 165-degrees. Offers adequate camera video quality. Even though Dogness claims a large 165-degree wide angle lens, in fact, is noticeably not as wide angle as the Petwant camera in real life testing. Also even though Dogness claims it is fitted with a HD camera the quality of the images shows otherwise. It feels more like an SD camera, or the worst quality HD camera I\u2019ve ever tested. Has significantly smaller aperture sensor size than the Petwant so needs a larger amount of sunlight to register the same amount of exposure on the camera feedback. Useable but not good iso performance and exposure spectrum, and aren\u2019t able to capture as much detail in images as the Petwant during standard sunlight mode. Granted I\u2019m really picky about image quality but I think the average non-camera centric person will find it acceptable.\n\nHowever, it has a great night vision function. For some reason when in night vision mode, it has improved picture quality, color depth, and clarity. Does an okay job of switching from daylight mode to night mode on its own but could be greatly improved. Its threshold for darkness is not very high, so even though there is enough sunlight to see adequately using the camera, the software will decide for you to jump the gun and switch to night mode which can be frustrating. I wish you could manually choose which mode to use instead of relying on the ai to decide on its own when to turn it on appropriately, or if there was an option to set the nightmode darkness sensitivity so you could change the threshold on how sensitive the nightmode activation is.\n\n**Microphone/ Audio Sound Quality:** Works great with little to no background static noise, separate talk and listen function like a walkie talkie. Would like to see improvement with a two-way audio and mic function instead so you can need only one button to talk and listen not two separate buttons. Speaker and audio are the clearest on this feeder, has the highest clarity in audio and speaker feedback.\n\n**Google Assistant/Alexa Compatible:** None. Would love to see this feature added in the future.\n\n**In case of power failure**: Is very reliable and will continue to dispense food even if the power goes out using batteries (confirmed) and even if it cannot connect to the WiFi network for many days probably even capable for weeks (confirmed via testing). It stores the last known feeding instructions on to the actual physical feeder hardware itself instead of an outside cloud network which is optimal so it will continue feeding your pet.\n\n**Portion Size:** Capable of dispensing 1/16 - roughly 3.5 cups each meal up to 6 pre-schedule meals.\n\n**Bowl:** Can hold 3 cups of food. Has a stainless steel bowl removable liner. Tilted angled shape perfect for making kibble fall and dispense equally near the bottom of the bowl instead of piling up at the location of the dispensing hole like other feeders preventing jams and food backing up into the food dispensing chute. Smartest and most practical feeder design tested.\n\n**Food level Sensor:** No. The company claims to be working on implementing it on a newer app version in the future. But so far doesn\u2019t have it, but does tell you when there is no more food in the container to dispense.\n\n**Excess food Sensor:** Fantastic.\n\n**Seal on Food Container:** Fantastic. Rubber gasket on container\u2019s seal provides the best airtight seal on the food container out of all the pet feeders. Also has a slot to hold a packet of desiccant to prevent moisture contamination. Seems to keeps dry food the freshest from spoilage, staleness and prevents unwanted pests.\n\nEvent management log: The most reliable at accurately logging dispensed food and diagnosing all specific issues and errors with the machine. \n\n**Multi-Pet use:** Yes. It can be used to bind multiple dogness feeders and other dogness smart products to ONE app account. You can use multiple different phones to log into the same account to control the same feeder as long as they are not attempting to log in at the same time. \n\n**Pros:**\n\nCan bind multiple Dogness smart products and control them all from the same account\n\nNightvision function\n\nBest Integrated speaker and mic\n\nLargest food capacity\n\nWorks with big and odd shaped kibble\n\nBest seal on the food container\n\nNever jams cause of smart angled bowl and food chute design\n\nEasy Install and Setup\n\nStainless steel bowl\n\nReliable event management\n\nReliable error diagnosis\n\nReliable wifi network connection\n\nCustomer service phone number is located in USA and is very responsive\n\n**Cons:** \n\nIntegrated video camera quality, aperture and lens wideness could be better\n\nOverly sensitive nightmode\n\nNot Google Assistant/Alexa compatible\n\nNo food level sensor yet\n\nNo option to switch to standard time\n\nNo option to switch to imperical cup food measuring\n\nDogness products are new to the market and just started selling their products recently, app has a lot of room to improve upon to be more functional - expect growing pains.\n\nNo custom pet nutrition and serving recommendations on app\n\n# 2nd Gen Petnet : [https://www.amazon.com/Petnet-SF20A-W-SmartFeeder-Automatic-Feeder/dp/B07C3V32VR/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049577&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=petnet+smartfeeder+2.0](https://www.amazon.com/Petnet-SF20A-W-SmartFeeder-Automatic-Feeder/dp/B07C3V32VR/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049577&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=petnet+smartfeeder+2.0)\n\n**Capacity:** Claims 5-7 lbs of food / I Measured: 17 cups\n\n**Time:** Standard\n\n**Meals Units:** Imperical system cup portions.\n\n**Jam Occurrence:** Ocassionally will jam once every 10 meals if used with odd shaped or large kibble. It doesn\u2019t jam if you are using small round kibble.\n\n**Wifi Connectivity Reliability:** I had so many wifi issues, and had to try a few times to bind the feeder to wifi with random luck. Unable to diagnose issues just had to hope it worked each time. Has consistent issues with dropping network connection over time even within the same day sometimes. May would work better with a non-mesh router. It\u2019s also dumb that the barcode you need access to in order to bind the Petnet to your wifi is located on the bottom of the base of the feeder, so you have to flip it upside down every time you want to reconnect it. \n\n**Camera/Video Quality:** None included compared to other feeders on the market which are cheaper and have integrated cameras. Claims that it is Nest camera compatible however if you desire a video camera functionality on your Petnet. I don\u2019t have a nest camera so I didn\u2019t get to test this functionality to see how it performed in real-life testing.\n\n**Google Assistant/Alexa Compatible:** It claims it\u2019s compatible but it\u2019s terrible. Would not recommend. Didn't test with Alexa since I only use Google products in my home. But if it's anything like the compatibility to Google it's terrible. May as well not exist. Most of the time doesn't register that Petnet is even linked to your Google assistant. Can never find your Petnet to manually link it to your Google assistant either.\n\n**In case of power failure**: Petnet claims 7 hours-2 days of battery life without wifi or power which means you are SOL in case it happens while you are on vacation. It stores the last known feeding instructions onto an outside third party server cloud network which has a history of going down and when it goes down Petnet feeders will fail to work and dispense food. This could be improved if they stored the data onto the actual feeders themselves like other smart feeders.\n\n**Portion size:** Capable of dispensing 1/16 - 1 1/2 cups each meal. Can preschedule up to 5 meals in a day. In the past the app was able to schedule an unlimited number of meals, this is not the case as of now but hopefully this changes in the future.\n\n**Bowl:** Claims to hold 2.5 cups of dry food. Has a dishwasher safe metal bowl removable liner. The flat shape of the bowl prevents kibble from dispensing equally to the bottom of the bowl. Relies on the motor of the feeder to shoot out food farther down the bowl. Inevitably kibble piles up at the location of the dispensing hole like other feeders causing it to more often has food backing up into the food dispensing chute but it's not as often or as bad as the Petwant feeder. \n\nPro: compared to the Petwant it has a more angled chute so it is able to have better even kibble distribution to the bowl but the angled design is not as angled as the Dogness which relies on a smart bowl shape and gravity feed design instead of the motor power to push down the kibble a farther distance into the bowl.\n\n**Food Level Sensor:** Best food level sensor, the app does a good job of estimating how much food is left in the container.\n\n**Excess Food Sensor:** Meh. It\u2019s super inconsistent. I don\u2019t trust it\u2019s notifications and diagnosis of issues at all. If it gets the issue correct it was more luck than good programming.\n\n**Seal on Food Container:** Good. No rubber gasket on container\u2019s seal but seems to provide an adequate seal on the food container based on a tension locking system. Doesn\u2019t have a slot to hold a packet of desiccant to prevent moisture contamination. Seems to keeps dry food the adequately fresh from going stale but can be improved with the implementation of an airtight rubber gasket. \n\n**Accuracy of Event Management Log:** Usable but needs improvement and is not reliable. 50% of the time will work, 50% of the time it will sometimes not log events correctly and have false positive notifications (dispense excess food, jam, abnormal machine, network error, no food, etc.), sometimes will not even log an event at all even though it had dispensed food, or will log it had dispensed food but didn\u2019t.\n\n**Multi-Pet Use:** No. It can only be used to bind ONE feeder to ONE app account. App only allows you to control one feeder at a time. But you can use multiple different phones to log into the same account to control the same feeder as long as they are not attempting to log in at the same time. If you have multiple pets currently the only way to manage multiple feeders from a single smartphone/tablet is by creating a second account with a different email and logging in with it. You could also use a second smartphone/tablet to control the second SmartFeeder. Petnet claims to have a version of the app in the works that they will call \"Multi-pet\" so you don\u2019t have to log in and out to control multiple feeders.\n\n**Pros:**\n\nGood food capacity\n\nGood seal on food container\n\nFood portions are in Cups\n\nUses standard time\n\nAttractive app design\n\nApp has custom pet nutrition and serving recommendations for lots of different pet food\n\nIntegrated smartdelivery function to rebuy dog food when food is low\n\nBest food level sensor\n\nGoogle Assistant/Alexa/Nest compatible\n\nStainless steel bowl\n\nCustomer service phone number is located in USA and is responsive\n\n**Cons:** \n\nCannot bind multiple feeders and control them all from the same account (best for single pet home)\n\nNo Integrated video camera\n\nNo Integrated speaker and mic\n\nJams occasionally cause of a flat bowl causing food to pile up near the food chute\n\nThere is a gap of space between the bowl and food chute in gen 2 that kibble dust annoyingly collects in\n\nGoogle Assistant compatibility is terrible\n\nUnreliable event management\n\nUnreliable error diagnosis\n\nMost unreliable wifi network connection - not reliable with mesh router systems\n\n# Petwant/Jempet/Wopet (pf-103): [https://www.amazon.com/Petwant-SmartFeeder-Automatic-Dispenser-Controlled/dp/B01GFTZPDQ/ref=sr\\_1\\_6?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049545&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=petwant+automatic+pet+feeder](https://www.amazon.com/Petwant-SmartFeeder-Automatic-Dispenser-Controlled/dp/B01GFTZPDQ/ref=sr_1_6?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551049545&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=petwant+automatic+pet+feeder)\n\n**Capacity:** Claims 4.3 liters / I measured 14 cups\n\n**Time:** Military\n\n**Meal Units:**: Metric gram portions\n\n**Jam Occurance:** Best with cat food and very small breed dog kibble the size of a pea, and round shaped kibble. When tested with small kibble it rarely ever (maybe at most every 6 months) had issues jamming and was very reliable. Jams all the time with anything bigger than small pea sized kibble. Will jam once every 4 meals if used with a medium to large kibble size, or non-round shaped kibble. If you want to make it work with big kibble I heard you could alter the feeder yourself.\n\n**Wifi Connectivity Reliability:** It never had problems connecting to WiFi as long as you have a compatible router. Rarely (maybe once every 6 months) drops network connection and has to be manually hard restarted and reconnected most likely this reliability depends on your network router compatibility. \n\n**In case of power failure**: Is very reliable and will continue to dispense food even if the power goes out using batteries (confirmed) and even if it cannot connect to the WiFi network for many days probably even capable for weeks (confirmed via testing). I haven\u2019t changed the initial D batteries since I got it 2.5 years ago. It stores the last known feeding instructions on to the actual physical feeder hardware itself instead of a outside cloud network which is optimal so it will continue feeding your pet.\n\n**Camera/Video Quality:** Claims 720p HD wide-angle 120 degrees. Best camera video quality. Even though it claims only 120-degree wide angle lens, it, in fact, has the best widest angle lens and gives you the clearest quality HD image even at only 720p. Significantly better camera lens than the Dogness feeder. Has the widest aperture sensor size, the best iso performance and best exposure, and is able to capture significantly more detail in images. This truly feels like a HD camera. No night vision function, best if paired with a home that has smart lights installed thus removing the need for night vision.\n\n**Microphone/ Audio Sound Quality:** Works adequately. Loud annoying background static noise whenever using listen function. Mic and audio are two separate talk and listen functions like a walkie talkie. Would like to see improvement with a two-way sound and mic function instead so you can need only one button to talk and listen not two seperate buttons. Speaker is adequately clear on this feeder but can be greatly improved, has a lot of background noise garbling. Clarity in audio and speaking feedback is usable but not ideal.\n\n**Google Assistant/Alexa compatible:** None\n\n**Portion size:** Capable of dispensing 1/16 - 1 cup each meal up to 4 pre-scheduled meals\n\n**Bowl:** Holds about 2 and \u00bd cups of dry food. Does not have a dishwasher safe stainless steel bowl removable liner, only a detachable plastic bowl. Can foresee some pets getting some acne sensitivity since the bowl is made from plastic. Plastic is porous and can grow and house bacteria in the surface micro pockets from holding pet food over time. The flat shape of the bowl prevents kibble from dispensing equally to the bottom of the bowl. The motor of the feeder is not strong enough to shoot out food farther down the bowl like the Petnet. If you choose to dispense more than a few portions, kibble regularly piles up at the location of the dispensing hole causing it to regularly have food backing up into the food dispensing chute jamming the chute. The worst design flaw out of all the feeders in this regard. You can get around this issue by taking the bowl off and putting the feeder on some stacked books to have the food free drop from the food chute down into the unconnected bowl.\n\n**Food Level Sensor:** None but will tell you if there is no more food via a push notification if there are no issues with jamming which can trigger a false positive no food level error.\n\n**Excess Food Sensor:** Does a good job most of the time but jamming issues can trigger a false positive dispensed excess food error.\n\n**Seal on Food Container:** Bad. No rubber gasket on container\u2019s seal and seems to not provide an adequate seal on the food container. Lid only clicks into place so it is the least pet-proof, insect, pest and spoilage proof. Food gets stale super fast because air easily circulates through the container. Doesn\u2019t have a slot to hold a packet of desiccant to prevent moisture contamination.\n\n**Accuracy of Event Management Log:** Usable but needs improvement and is not reliable. Will most of the time log events but it will regularly not log events correctly and have false positive notifications,(dispense excess food, jam, abnormal machine, network error, no food, etc.) sometimes will log it had dispensed food but didn\u2019t at all.\n\n**Multi-Pet Use:** No. It can only be used to bind ONE feeder to ONE app account. App only allows you to control one feeder at a time. But you can use multiple different phones to log into the same account to control the same feeder as long as they are not attempting to log in at the same time. App doesn\u2019t have multiple feeder compatibility. \n\n**Pros:**\n\nBest Integrated HD video camera quality, aperture and lens wideness so you can see the whole room\n\nEasy Install and Setup\n\nReliable wifi network connection\n\nCheapest smart pet feeder with camera, audio, and speaker function\n\n**Cons:** \n\nIntegrated speaker, audio and mic could be better\n\nJams consistently if not using small kibble because of the flat bowl and food chute design\n\nSmall food capacity\n\nPlastic Bowl\n\nNo Night vision\n\nCannot bind multiple feeders and control them all from the same account (best for single pet home)\n\nBad seal on the food container (allows pests, air circulates and food goes stale)\n\nUnreliable event management\n\nUnreliable error diagnosis\n\nNot Google Assistant/Alexa compatible\n\nNo food level sensor\n\nNo option to switch to standard time\n\nNo option to switch to imperical cup food measuring\n\nCustomer service is located in china and is unresponsive",

                    "I'm surprised the haters didn't jump on you yet about not needing to board your dog.  Last time feeders were discussed I mentioned how my dog has a pet door and a nice big backyard with a secure fence and would leave her for quick weekend trips and have my niece check in on her a couple times a day I was informed of how horrible of a person I am.\n\nI have a similar situation to you where I have random late days due to work and it's nice to be able to feed my dog remotely.  I have a petnet and it's worked well enough for me... they have had numerous server issues, which led me to just use it for all of my dogs meals so it's already scheduled and I'm not doing it on demand where I'm not certain the service will be online.  It's not very flexible, you can't cancel just one meal if you are planning on taking your dog hiking and will be feeding it on the road, you'll have to come home and dump the food back in the reservoir.  You can't do complex schedules like only auto feed on weekdays.  It's pretty much an all or nothing.",

                    "My 2 cents if it's worth anything...When I was a pet sitter in NYC, I would have clients who would hire me to drop in multiple times a day on their dogs during short trips or even more than a week at a time regularly. I would say a lot of people choose to do this, especially if they have more than one pet (some clients had a zoo of animals) making boarding very costly especially in NYC where boarding one pet alone costs minimum $70-$200+/night and some of these facilities they just stay in a kennel most of the day with no interaction except to be walked to go to the bathroom. The other situation I saw this often was with dogs who had behavioral issues, were elderly so didn't move around much, disabled or had medical issues (human or dog aggression, reactive, etc.) that made it dangerous, very unsafe and uncomfortable for the dog to be boarded outside of their home or be with other dogs in a unfamiliar environment with strangers. \n\nI would say it's very common at least in NYC to have someone drop in on dogs not just cats and leave them for short trips depending on the temperament of the individual dog. Optimally if we all had the money to hire around the clock care for all our dogs that would be great (I used to do this as well for wealthier families who needed pet hospice care), but I think it's unrealistic if we want to be able to re-home the enormous number of pets in the animal shelters.\n\nThanks for the longer term use review of the Petnet. I can see the how the Petnet would do well in a situation like yours. They really put a lot of effort to make their app and design of their machine very aesthetically pleasing, it's easily the slickest looking app I've used.",

                    "For us my partner and I both work in medicine where 24 hour call is at least 1-2 times a week and sometimes we get called in to go to work unscheduled. Our dog is pretty low maintenance since he has access to our yard through a dog door, a huge bowl of water and his smart feeder. We just have a dog walker come walk him during call days and he otherwise can take care of himself like a cat. I can also check on him using the camera (which is mostly for me cause I miss and worry about him when I'm away). Most of our friends also work in medicine with long hours as nurses, doctors, scientists and med students so they also all have smart auto pet feeders.\nThe more time we can spend efficiently on the mundane chores the more time we can spend doing everything else (patients, kids, self care, playing with pets, chores, etc).\n\n1. If the pet feeder is reliable with very little failure rate you no longer need a pet sitter for short trips or long nights at work. You can just get someone to drop in occasionally as bookchaser mentioned.\n2. Pets will stop begging you to serve them food since they learn it only comes from the feeder.\n3. If you have a overweight pet you can take the human error element out of portioning their food correctly when they are on a diet plan especially if you have a super highly dense kibble brand. It helps to have more meals throughout the day rather than less meals that are bigger.\n4. When you have a diabetic pet, they may need to have regular smaller meals consistently throughout the day, when someone may not always be available.\n5. If you have a pet who doesn't have an off switch on eating food and will continue to eat til they get sick. They do better on portioned meals throughout the day and can't be trusted with an traditional auto feeder.\n6. When you have a physically disability its easier to refill the food container only once a week versus a bowl several times a day.\n7. I don't have to worry about my pet sitter feeding my pet correctly on time when I'm gone for vacation. \n8. My dog doesn't eat enough, so I can keep track with how much he is eating daily with a smart feeder vs. a traditional auto feeder since he has some developing health issues.\n9.

I couldn't get my Petwant feeder to connect for 3 months before with a Nighthawk Netgear router I had bought and then I switched to a Google WiFi mesh router and it resolved all my wifi connection issues.\n\nAll dog feeders as far as I've seen on the market only are compatible with 2.4 GHz networks. I'm not a networking expert I'd recommend talking to a person with more experience in networking to resolve your connection issue if my above suggestions don't work for your petwant. I don't know if the Dogness feeder will work with your network set up or any dog feeder for that matter though it tends to be more reliable in my experience.\n",

            "Cross-platform Hue Dimmer Switch Using the \"Borrowed Bulb\" Trick and webCoRE. How to get any of your Hue devices in Smartthings! (X-Post from r/smartthings)\nMy first attempt to explain this was [messy](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartThings/comments/b4ovz6/how_to_use_a_hue_dimmer_switch_with_smartthings/), and I've since realized that you don't actually need to use a *spare* bulb for this trick to work. You're much better off using a *borrowed* bulb instead!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a method to unlock the full smart-home potential of your Hue Dimmer switch. Use it to control Smartthings... *things*, or turn on /off Hue bulbs across multiple bridges. All without limiting/changing it's current functioning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Hue Dimmer switch, compared to the Smartthings button, has *many* more buttons to play around with (but you'll lose the temperature sensor... if you care). The Hue dimmer, with a third party app, allows for full customization of: *Press*, *Hold*, *Short Press, Long Press* for each of the 4 buttons. That's *16 triggers*, compared to the Smartthings button's 3. Not to mention; the Hue Dimmer can be set to \"First press, second press, third press; etc...\".\n\nThe Hue Dimmer is overall much more capable as a switch: and it looks nicer on a wall :) Plus they're around the same price; so, *why not?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What you'll need to unchain your Hue Dimmer:**\n\n* A Hue bulb borrowed from a friend; or\n* A bulb that's linked from one of your *other* Hue Bridges (you're an addict, get help)\n* A third party app that allows adjusting brightness to a specific # value to the dimmer switch (HueDynamic, All4Hue, Hue Essentials; just about *any* app)\n* Smartthings hub; linked to your Hue bridge\n* WebCoRE\n\n**Side Note:** You *could* just use a currently used bulb; but that would be annoying, and a waste. A *phantom bulb* would make everything much more practical without hindering any current configurations.\n\n# Stage 1: Creating a Phantom Bulb\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1:** Pair your *borrowed bulb* to your main hue bridge; or, in my case: I swapped two bulbs from two separate Bridges (I'm an addict), then paired the bulbs with the opposite Bridges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 2:** Rename the bulb to *\"Phantom bulb\"* (It doesn't *have* to be called this; but yes, it does).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 3:** Now pair the bulb(s) back to the original bridge(s) again. All the settings; the bulb's original name, assigned room, and dimmer buttons, will be restored to normal.\n\n# Stage 2: Program your Phantom Bulb into a Hue Third-Party App\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1:** Open your app and find where you're able to program your devices (I've been saying Hue Dimmer this whole time; but it just dawned on me that you can do this with *any* device)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 2:** Program your Dimmer switch (or whatever) to *any* set # brightness value for *any button* in whatever variation you choose. Keep these #'s in mind for later when you're using webCoRE.\n\nExample:\n\n* Press ON = **100%** brightness\n* Press DIM UP = **75%** brightness\n* Press DIM DOWN = **74%** brightness\n* Press OFF = **1%** brightness\n\nI only used 4 settings in this example for simplicity's sake, but as mentioned earlier; you could set up literally *any* of the app's dimmer customization potential (short press, hold, long press, first press, sixteenth press; whatever). And it doesn't matter if the brightness settings are close together (ie. 74%, 75%) . Any number value from 1 to 100 will do.\n\n# Stage 3: Set up webCoRE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1:** Okay; you're already ahead of me and know *exactly* how to use webCoRE. Cool. Good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 0:** Oh? You have *no idea* how to use webCoRE??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What the hell *is* webCoRE anyway??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure. I found out about it yesterday. As of writing this tutorial, I'm *totally* new to webCoRE. I'm not even the type of guy to write tutorials (how am I doing??).\n\nTo get your hands into webCoRE, Just follow [these steps](https://wiki.webcore.co/#Installing_webCoRE). It's time consuming; but, *really* easy to follow. And once you're in, you're in. It's easy to use from there :) Trust me, it's well worth the effort and time! These guys wrote an *amazing*program for Smartthings.\n\n# Stage 4: Use webCoRE to map the Phantom Bulb to whatever smart stuff you want\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo steps here. This is *your* playground now! But as an example, [Here's my webCoRE script](https://imgur.com/mQAI8V4) for my current Hue Dimmer's ON button function.\n\nMy bathroom came with the lights and fan plugged into the same circuit. So I fixed that:\n\n* Bathroom fan is plugged into Smartthings smart plug\n* Hue Dimmer's ON (hold) button is set to change the *Phantom Bulb* to 100%. This means that pressing \\*just\\* ON leaves the fan alone; only lights will turn on.\n* webCoRE is then mapped to turn on the Bathroom fan's Smart plug when the Phantom bulb is \"equal to\" 99% brightness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's an amazing feeling when you can *see* your home automation working! :)",

Immediately when the button is pressed? Or when the button is let go?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where short press comes in handy, as in my example above. With an action for *short press,* and a separate action for *hold,* are assigned to the same button; that means the *short press* will be \"skipped\" when you *hold* the button.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhereas, for *press,* the button will trigger immediately upon pushing the button, then *hold* will also be triggered in one shot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This also comes in handy for making a 3-way switch from the Hue dimmer. *Hold* turns on upstairs. Short press turn on the main floor; and the opposite switch functions the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps!",

The map saving feature isn't that useful, the 1st generation still maps out your house, it just doesn't save it permanently in memory and \"re-maps\" each time. So the only reason you would need a more permanent map is if the vacuum has to go back and re-charge itself before it finishes cleaning.\n\nI have 1k square feet and it usually gets down to about 53% by the time it finishes. From what I have read you can't do borders even on the saved map, so the only real benefit is spot cleaning, which again, you can do with the 1st generation as long as you don't have a huge area to clean.",

She lives alone and wants to be able to monitor her driveway and back door. That said, I have a list of requirements and cam wondering if anyone on here has suggestions for a camera that meets them.\n\nThe camera needs to be able to operate in pretty extreme cold weather. -40 Celsius is not unheard of where she lives.\nWater/weather proof. The last thing I want is for the camera to die after 6 months and have to replace it.\nI want this to be as low-maintenance as possible. Wired is preferred over battery powered for this reason (especially with cold weather), although we could live with batteries if we had to. Easy to use is key as well. I live far away and my mom is not a tech savvy person, so I want to be able to show her how to use it and just have it work.\nMy mom is on rural internet, so her data cap is incredibly low and her internet is slow. A camera that can be set up so that it doesn't constantly stream data to the cloud is a must.\nBeing able to view on an external screen (Nest Hub, Echo Show) is a bonus. It will be faster and easier for her to look at a screen sitting in her kitchen than to find her phone and open the app whenever someone comes to the door.\nAvailable for purchase in Canada.\nI've looked into the Wyze Cam and it meets most of the criteria except that it's not weatherproof. I've looked into the \"weatherproof\" cases on Amazon and they don't seem to be waterproof at all. I actually bought a Wyze Cam to play around with and I really like it. I'm just not sure if I trust it not to die on her if I set it up outside.",

Not sure what your remote does and if your goal is to replace it or supplement with automation.\n\nIf you want to supplement, go the RF route as others suggest.\n\nTo automate on/off you just need a relay that your automation can control.  The fireplace generates a small electrical current from the heat of the pilot light.  There are quicktab connectors where you can attach a switch (or relay controlled by a remote), closing that loop triggers the valve to open.\n\nI had a wall switch which I disconnected.\n\nI bought a $5 relay, attached an old 5v power brick to it, and plugged that into an extra HomeKit outlet I had.  It took me about 10 minutes total, and I\u2019d never worked with a relay before.

The next big task to tackle is the 4 gang by the front door. One controls the driveway light, One controls the porch light, One controls the foyer light, and One is the add-on for a 3-way hallway light. \n\nI know that multiple smart switches is already a tight fit so I started looking for videos on how to do a 4-gang. I briefly remember some tips like chaining the neutrals together or something to that affect. But then I stumbled upon a thread that mentioned that this task may not even be possible due to wattage depreciation. I trust everyone here more than a random thread from a smart-things forum. \n\nI guess my first question is, is it even possible to use 4 smart switches in the same box? If so, is it just like wiring 4 individual switches? If I remove the side clips on them, is that enough to physically fit 4 in the box?",
