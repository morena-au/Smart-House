On top of that, even though the speakers were hidden behind thin black fabric, the listeners would have been able to identify the speakers as their flashing lights shone through the material. Thus, Brent insisted that Geoff and Lauren each wear a special pair of ""blind-testing glasses""—sunglasses covered with painter’s tape. The listeners were so well isolated that when the music started, he had to clap loudly to signal the listeners to remove the headphones. The two speakers’ coarse volume steps made it impossible to match their listening levels perfectly, but Brent was able to get the match within 0.43 dB, which is reasonably close.', 'Geoff, Lauren, and Brent all ended up describing the sound of the two speakers much the same way. It was a Goldilocks-style dilemma: The original Echo seemed to have almost no bass, so much of the drive and rhythm of the music was lost, and voices could sound harsh and sibilant. But the Home had a muffled midrange and treble, making voices harder to understand. Lauren summed up the group’s unhappiness when she concluded, ""I … guess I’d prefer the sibilant one?""

For starters, the Echo played 4.5 dB louder than the Home in our tests. In a bedroom or kitchen, such a difference probably doesn’t matter, but in a very large living room, the Home might not sound loud enough. The Echo is a true omnidirectional speaker, too, so it will more easily fill a large space with sound.

If you’re an Amazon Prime member, you can order products from Amazon directly through Alexa (remember to activate the PIN to prevent unauthorized orders), and Amazon has exclusive daily deals for Alexa users.', 'Alexa’s other advantage over the Home platform is its ever-expanding catalog of Skills (over 15,000), which are like apps for voice-controlled speakers. Many of these skills are developed by services you might already use, such as Todoist, Task Penguin, My Notebook, Task Master, Priority Board, and Cubic Reminder. Enabling them allows you to personalize Alexa to your needs, and they are a definite point in Amazon’s favor; if a service you use isn\'t offered directly through Alexa\'s Skills library, plenty of IFTTT applets\xa0are also available.

To use this new feature, you’ll need to update the app and then authorize the feature in the app. It will automatically populate a contacts list based on your phone’s contacts, but only with people who have added the feature on their end. If you know you have Alexa owners in your phone’s address book, but don’t see them in the Alexa contact list, that’s because those people haven’t added the feature themselves. Calling or sending messages is easy—just ask Alexa to call or send a message to a person. You can also dictate a specific phone number. The LED ring on the recipient’s Echo will glow green, indicating a call or message, and that person then tells Alexa to answer the call or play the message. In our tests the sound quality was pretty good, too. You can also use your connected Echos, Taps, Dots, and Shows as a home intercom system. All you have to do is give a name to each of your devices and enable the “drop-in” feature, and you can initiate walkie-talkie intercom chats between any two devices in the house. If you have the Echo Show, Look, or Spot, you can use these features to video-chat as well, at no additional charge.\xa0As of February 2018, Alexa also supports text messaging for Android users (but not group texting)', 'Though great for starting an inexpensive multiroom audio system and more able to interface with some Google products, the Google Home is still catching up with the Echo.', 'The Google Home’s main advantage over the Echo and Alexa is, well, Google. The Home system attempts to answer more questions, offers a bit more contextual information, and usually gives a longer (though not necessarily more informative) answer. A digital marketing firm conducted a test published in early March 2017 in which testers\xa0threw 5,000 questions at each device. The Google Home attempted to answer more than 60 percent of the questions, while the Echo attempted to answer only about 20 percent. Of the questions they attempted to answer, both were correct more than 80 percent of the time.', 'In practice, when we asked what the smartest dog was, the Home said it was the collie, while the Echo kept silent, probably out of respect for a hound dog that happened to be in the room. When we asked what the best Bluetooth speaker was, the Home had no answer, while the Echo suggested a Bose model that happened to be a Wirecutter pick, then (unsurprisingly) asked if it should order that speaker from Amazon right at that moment. Both can do math, tell you the population of China, and state how many teaspoons are in a cup. Google is better if you ask how to roast a chicken or what wine goes with steak, but you can find more than 300\xa0Alexa skills about cooking and another 100 or so for wine fans.', 'On simple information searches, the Home attempts to answer more questions, offers a bit more contextual information, and usually gives a longer (though not necessarily more informative) answer.', 'One of the other search-related advantages the Home offers over Amazon’s smart speakers is the ability to track the context of your queries based on previous inputs. For instance, after you ask ""Hey Google, when did the Sex Pistols form?"" and receive your answer, you can follow up with “Hey Google, who was the lead singer?” without having to say “Sex Pistols” again. (You’ll still have to say “Hey Google” every time.) However, in our time with the device, we didn’t find much use for that feature. Amazon added contextual awareness to Alexa late in 2016, but the Home system still does it better. In November 2017, Google Home added the ability to understand two commands at once; Alexa speakers gained this feature shortly after.', 'It’s worth noting that Alexa’s ability to answer questions seems to have improved over time. A year ago, when I asked Alexa for the phone number of my favorite local pizza shop, it couldn’t give me an answer, but would tell me the distance to the restaurant. Now it can give me the phone number, too. However, sometimes what it can and can’t answer is baffling. It accurately told me when the next season of Game of Thrones would begin, but couldn’t tell me how many Game of Thrones books there are (though it offered to order the complete collection for me from Amazon).', 'Perfect for audio-lite applications or connecting to an existing music system or Bluetooth speaker.', 'You save $39 (81%)', ""Neither the Echo nor the Home is a\xa0smart-home system in and of itself, but their ability to act as convenient controllers for popular smart-home devices makes them central figures in a smart home. They’re not hubs, like SmartThings or Wink; rather, they're more like voice-activated universal remotes, the duct tape that binds together disparate, often competing systems that otherwise wouldn’t play nicely. In this respect, Amazon’s Echo is the clear winner, because it controls far more smart-home devices than the Home, including Nest, Philips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, LIFX, Lutron Caseta, Belkin Wemo, Wink, Alarm.com, and more; the Echo Plus also has built-in Zigbee compatibility\xa0for seamless integration."", 'Google is gradually catching up to Amazon, but it still has a long way to go.

Once it shows up you’ll be asked to name it (e.g., Living Room Nest, Kitchen Sink Light, Dining Room Sconces). You can also add it to a group (such as All Lights, All Thermostats, or Christmas Decorations). Naming and grouping are important for managing your devices. By placing several items in the same group, such as a couple of Hue bulbs, a WeMo switch, and a Lutron switch, and calling the group ""Living Room Lights,"" you can control multiple devices at once. A device can be in more than one group at a time; however, it’s useful to make sure a device name and a group name are not so similar sounding that Alexa gets confused.', 'Note that we haven’t tried all the products that integrate with Alexa. You can find a complete list of Alexa-compatible devices on Amazon’s Alexa page.', 'The Google Home system does a good job controlling the smart-home devices it works with, but it doesn’t work with quite as many devices as the Echo system. However, sometimes the Home’s integrations are a bit easier to use. For example, its Nest integration lets you say ""Hey Google, make it warmer"" in order to raise the temperature. With the Echo, you need to say “Alexa, turn living room Nest to XX degrees,” and if you say it incorrectly it won’t work. Still, that doesn’t matter if the Home won’t work at all with the smart devices you already own or are planning to buy. For now, you have at least a few options for most smart-home services, in addition to the less-reliable IFTTT applets. Google Nest Hub owners can also control all of their smart home devices from the Home View dashboard on the display screen. Check out our guide to the best smart devices for Google Home\xa0for more information.', 'In March 2018, the company added “routines” to Google Home, so you can, for example, use one command to turn off all the lights and lower the thermostat. In July 2018, Google announced that you can now schedule those routines to happen automatically at a certain time instead of having to say “Hey Google, goodnight.”', 'While most smart speakers are more focused on audio than video, some people might want to connect their Echo or Home to an indoor or outdoor security camera, a video doorbell, or another visual smart-home device. Google gets a slight edge in this regard thanks to Chromecast, which allows you to stream video to any Chromecast-enabled screen, using the Home as a central hub. Both Chromecast and the video-enabled Echo models will let you stream videos with voice commands, too.', 'In the spring of 2017, Amazon released the first camera-enabled Alexa device, the Echo Look. After that came the Echo Spot and  Echo Show, which both have built-in screens so you can watch videos or chat with friends in addition to using the standard smart speaker capabilities. Google released a similar video-enabled smart speaker, the Google Home Hub, now called the Google Nest Hub, in fall 2018. Unlike the Echo models, the Nest Hub doesn’t have a camera, so you can’t use it to video-chat with friends (which could be a relief for some privacy-minded people). However, it does have a dashboard view that lets you control all of your smart-home devices from a single screen, as well as a step-by-step recipe library. When it’s not in active use, the Nest Hub defaults to being a digital photo frame. In May 2019, Google also announced the Nest Hub Max, which has a 10-inch display, a larger speaker than the smaller Nest Hub, and a camera on the front that you can use as a security camera or for video calls. You can disable the camera with a switch on the back, but doing so will also disable the device’s microphone.', ""If you’re more interested in smart-home controls than music control,\xa0HomeKit using Siri as the voice assistant is a good option.

While Cortana works with Insteon smart-home hubs, it has no other device integration at the moment, though that kind of functionality is in the works. In fall 2017, Harman Kardon released a Cortana-powered speaker similar to the Echo and the Home.

We plan to test that speaker when it becomes available.', 'Both the Echo and the Home feature always-on microphones, though each includes a mute button to turn off the mic if you want some privacy. As voice-controlled speakers, they need to always be alert for your commands, which means they’re listening to every sound within their hearing range (which in our experience seems to generally be about the size of a 300-square-foot room, depending on how loudly you speak). When the speaker hears its wake word, it jumps into action and sends a recording of the command it heard to its cloud servers, where the command is translated into an action; then you get music, an answer, or whatever it is you asked it to do. The process, while it may vary slightly depending on your Internet connection, can be instantaneous or take up to a few seconds.', 'The fact that these speakers are always listening concerns some users and privacy advocates. If all you’re ever asking for are playlists, weather forecasts, and help with algebra problems, this may not be an issue for you. However, the speakers’ tendency to mis-hear a wake word and record things that aren’t actually commands could be an issue. In fact, in 2016 police requested access to the archived recordings of an Echo to discover if it could aid in a murder investigation. Amazon initially declined the request; when asked about the matter, representatives\xa0told WBS-TV\xa0that ""Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us.

Google is probably collecting more data overall than Amazon, because it has more tools to do so, including its main search tool, the Chrome browser, the Maps app, Gmail, and the calendar. All of this is outlined in the company’s privacy page. Both Amazon and Google let users delete all recordings, but warn users that deleting information may also affect how well the systems respond to you.

I would like to know how many of those 12k skills are native to Google through its native capacity....', "" How the heck do you get your cellphone to connect to be able to make phone calls ..I installed the Alexa app but it doesn't show a conversation bubble in the bottom like the instructions say? Is it because I'm in canada"", "" Hi Dave. Hmm, that's tricky. Do you have iOS 9.0 or higher? Or Android OS 5.0 or higher? Alexa can be picky about certain phones. Do you have both WiFi and cellular functionality enabled on your phone? Although Amazon announced that Alexa should work for voice calls in all of North America, perhaps they haven't ironed out all the issues yet. There's a discussion in this Reddit thread among people who are having the same problem—the top comment has step-by-step instructions for a solution you could try: https://www.reddit.com/r/am..."", "" He's probably got a Nokia 3310 ;)"", ' Just trying to play streaming radio stations has suddenly become a problem for Google Home.  My echo Dot is fine playing my preferred local PBS KUOW, but starting about a week ago Google Home will not:  it states this station is unavailable. It currently finds another station I listen to (KNKX), but would not play that one either for several days.  We can listen on our phones & computers, and Echo has no such problem.  No idea why Google can no longer play some radio stations still available to Amazon Echo! In the past, I could play KUOW via both IHeart Radio or TuneIn with Google Home.', ' I personally went with Google Home because I like the more natural language syntax. However, I was very frustrated that neither Google Play music nor Google home work with G Suite (Google apps) personalized domains. I can\'t imagine why they wouldn\'t make Google Play available to any email address...especially one that is in their ""system"". Makes no sense. I really like the looks of the Echo Spot.', ' Totally agree. The lack Of support for G Suite is just stupid. I got one for my daughter as she doesn’t live with me and I can’t evn add things to her calendar for her. Dumb.', ' What about the Google Home Mini? How does that compare to the Echo Dot or the Google Home?', "" How about going for new Lenovo Smart Display? I've been loving mine ever since I purchased it a week or so ago. Feels like my Google Home got an upgrade now that there's a nifty screen that support videos, photos and such!"", "" The Google Mini is nice, but like the Dot, it isn't a music-ready speaker for most people, and you can't connect it to a Bluetooth speaker or a separate stereo system because there's no line out or Bluetooth out."", "" A lot of people say this, but I feel like it's a bit of a canned comment. I personally don't have any major qualms about the sound quality from my Google Home Mini for casual listening. When I'm on the go, I typically listen to music on a pair of 4-driver Westone IEMs, so I know good audio quality. But, when I'm just working around my room, the audio from the mini is more than good enough for music and podcasts. Compare that with an Echo Dot we got as a gift, which has horrible tinny audio quality (and now sits unplugged in a drawer)."", "" I got mine on black Friday and love my mini. I got Chromecast to go with it and now use voice commands on my tv. I wish they covered it in here too so I know everything it can do. I was impressed with how powerful it was. btw I went with mini since I have android and hate amazon fire.

I ended up building a calculator which calculates which one is best for YOU based on YOUR needs.

I have multiple Echo's in the house and also a pre-existing hardwired multiroom audio speaker system. I put an Echo Dot on the hardwired system and when I tell Echo to play everywhere, it will play on the hardwired system as well as the Echo devices I designated in the app. It works pretty well and it doesn't go out of sync.""]"
